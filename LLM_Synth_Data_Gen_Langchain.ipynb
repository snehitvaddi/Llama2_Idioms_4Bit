I. Title. PE 2839.A47 1997 423\\'.1?97-12390\\ndc21 CIP\\nManufactured in the United States of America \\nPreface \\nThis book is a comprehensive survey of the idioms currently used in American \\nEnglish. An idiom is a set phrase of two or more words that means something \\ndifferent from the literal meaning of the individual words. For instance, the phrase \\nto change one\\'s tune  has nothing to do with music but means \"to alter one\\'s \\nattitude.\" Similarly, to hit the nail on the head  often has nothing to do with \\ncarpentry but means simply \"to be absolutely right.\" Idioms are the idiosyncrasies \\nof a language. Often defying the rules of logic, they pose great difficulties for \\nnon-native speakers. English abounds with phrases such as if worst comes to \\nworst, far and away,  and how do you do,  which, if translated literally, make no \\nsense. Indeed, the true test of an idiom is whether it changes meaning when \\nrendered word for word in another language. \\nIn addition to idioms, this book includes common figures of speech, such as dark \\nhorse and blind as a bat;  interjections and formula phrases, such as all the best\\nand take care;  emphatic redundancies whose word order cannot be reversed, such\\nas far and wide  and cease and desist;  common proverbs, especially ones that \\noften occur in abbreviated form, such as a bird in the hand;  colloquialisms such as\\noff the beam  and out in left field;  and slang phrases such as push the envelope. \\nEach expression is defined and illustrated by at least one sample sentence \\nshowing how it is used in context. In most cases the literal meaning of a phrase is \\nomitted; thus the entry hold up omits the definition \"keep upright\" or \"support.\" \\nWherever possible I have included information regarding the expression\\'s origin or\\nbackground, along with its date of first appearance. I have given approximate \\ndates for most idioms to allow for their probable use in speech before being \\nwritten down. \\nThe ultimate origin of many idioms is unknown. Some idioms, such as by hook or \\ncrook, use familiar words in obscure ways. Some preserve words that are \\notherwise obsolete, such as hue in hue and cry and fell in in one fell swoop.  I have\\ntried to explain these lost origins and obscure meanings whenever research can \\nshed light on them. The result is a dictionary that treats almost 10,000 English \\nexpressions in greater detail and depth than any other book available today. I file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n3 of 5 1/29/2008 10:02 AMhope that all speakers of English will find it both useful and enjoyable. \\nHeartfelt thanks are due to the many friends and acquaintances who have offered \\nvaluable suggestions, advice, and help, especially my husband Dean Ammer. \\nSpecial mention must be made of Joseph Pickett, Senior Lexicographer, and Susan\\nChicoski, Associate Editor, of Houghton Mifflin Company, and of their colleagues \\nDavid A. Jost and Kaethe Ellis for their invaluable expertise. I would also like to \\nthank Jesse Sheidlower of Random House for his generous help dating some of \\nthe slang expressions. The dictionary has been vastly improved through their \\nassistance. \\nCHRISTINE AMMER \\nGuide to Using this Book \\nEntries \\nAll entry phrases and synonymous variants are given in boldface type at the \\nbeginning of an entry before the definition. Related or similar expressions are \\ngiven in boldface in the text of the entry. Historical precedents and obsolete \\nphrases appear in italic type. Where a phrase has more than one meaning, \\ndefinitions are numbered, and whenever possible, ordered by frequency of use. \\nExample sentences appear in italic type, quotations in roman type within quotation\\nmarks, and cross-references in small capitals. \\nAlphabetization and Cross-References \\nEntries are arranged alphabetically, letter by letter up to the comma in the case of \\ninverted or appended elements. \\nTo locate an entry, it sometimes may be hard to decide which word in a phrase \\nwill come first in the alphabetical listing. For example, is as luck would have it\\nunder as or luck? To help sort out these problems, entries listing cross-references \\nfor key words appear alphabetically among the main entries. By checking these \\nkey-word entries, readers can locate every phrase treated as an entry in this book.\\nThe reader who does not find as luck would have it  under as can look under the \\nentries beginning with the next word, luck. If more help is needed, the entry for \\nthe word luck itself lists all the idioms containing that word which appear \\nelsewhere in the book. \\nVariants or related expressions that are covered under other entry words appear in\\nparentheses in the cross-references. Thus, at the entry soft the reader is referred \\nto HARD (SOFT) SELL, which means that the entry hard sell also treats the phrasefile:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n4 of 5 1/29/2008 10:02 AMsoft sell. Note, however, that words in parentheses are not considered part of the \\nalphabetical order, so one should look for hard sell, not hard soft sell. \\nVariable Pronouns \\nMany idioms can be used with different pronouns, as, for example, clean up his \\nact, clean up her act, clean up my act.  Consequently, the pronouns one and \\nsomeone are used in entry words and variants to indicate that the object or \\npossessive pronoun in the idiom may vary according to context. One or one\\'s \\nmeans that the antecedent of the pronoun must be the subject of the clause, or in\\nsome cases an inanimate noun or a gerund must be the subject. For example, the \\nidiom hit one\\'s stride  can appear in a sentence such as She finally hit her stride,  or\\nthe idiom serve one right  can be used in a sentence such as It serves him right to \\nbe thrown off the team.  But note that sentences like She finally hit his stride  are \\nnot possible. \\nThe use of someone or someone\\'s  in the idiom means that the pronoun can be \\nreplaced only by a noun or pronoun that does not refer to the grammatical subject\\nof the clause. In other words, the action of the verb is directed from one person to\\nanother (the \"someone\"). For example, the idiom call someone\\'s bluff  implies that \\nyou (or he or she or they) can only call someone else\\'s bluff, never your (or his or \\nher or their) own. \\nLabels \\nThe labels in brackets preceding the date of an idiom\\'s first appearance indicate \\nthe degree of formality or offensiveness. The label colloquial means that a phrase \\nis used in ordinary speech and informal writing but not in more formal contexts. \\nSlang generally refers to phrases that are appropriate only to very informal \\ncontexts or are used in irreverent humor. Vulgar slang  indicates that a phrase is \\ngenerally considered offensive. The absence of such a label indicates that a term \\nis considered standard English. \\nNote that these labels are bound to change, as are the idioms themselves. What is\\nslang today may be standard English tomorrow. Furthermore, what is common \\nusage for a time may die out (in this book indicated as obsolescent ) or it may \\nchange its meaning, as the idiom beg the question  may be doing. As \\nE.B. White put it, \"The living language is like a cowpath; it is the creation of the \\ncows themselves, who, having created it, follow it or depart from it according to \\ntheir whims or their needs. From daily use, the path undergoes change.\" \\nDating file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n5 of 5 1/29/2008 10:02 AMNearly all entries provide some indication of the idiom\\'s history. For many entries \\nthe date when the expression was invented or first used appears within brackets. \\nThese dates are often approximate because in many cases a phrase has been \\nused for some time in speech before being recorded in writing. In some cases, as \\nwhen the expression first appeared in the work of a well-known writer, the precise\\ndate and location of its first recorded use are given. Within brackets the \\nabbreviation c. (for Latin circa) is used to mean \"about,\" as in \"c. 1400.\" The \\nabbreviation A.D. is used for the years 1 through 1000; B.C. is used to indicate \\nyears before A.D. 1. \\nQuotations \\nUnless otherwise specified, biblical quotations are from the King James translation \\nof 1611. To avoid the difficulties posed to some readers by the English of earlier \\nwriters such as Chaucer, many quotations have had their spelling normalized, and \\nsome have been rendered into Modern English. \\nSources \\nAmong the principal sources used for dates and citations are, first and foremost, \\nThe Oxford English Dictionary,  Second Edition; The American Heritage Dictionary \\nof the English Language, Third Edition;  J.E.

In addition to the idioms beginning with ABIDE, also see CAN\\'T STAND\\n(ABIDE). \\nabide by \\nAccept and act in accordance with a decision or set of rules; also, remain faithful \\nto. For example, All members must agree to abide by the club regulations,  or A \\ntrustworthy man abides by his word.  An older sense of the verb abide, \"remain,\" is \\nstill familiar in the well-known 19th-century hymn \"Abide with Me,\" which asks \\nGod to stay with the singer in time of trouble. [Early 1500s] \\na bit \\n1. A small amount of anything; also, a short period of time. For example, Here\\'s a \\nbit of wrapping paper,  or It\\'ll be ready in a bit,  or Just wait a bit.  [c. 1600] 2.\\nSomewhat or rather, as in It stings a bit, or Will you have a bit more to eat?\\n[Second half of 1600s] Also see BIT BY BIT; NOT A BIT. \\nabout \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ABOUT, also see AT ABOUT; \\nBEAT ABOUT THE BUSH; BRING ABOUT; CAST ABOUT; COME ABOUT; DO AN \\nABOUT-FACE; GET ABOUT; GO ABOUT (ONE\\'S BUSINESS); HOW ABOUT (THAT); \\nJUST ABOUT; KNOCK ABOUT; LAY ABOUT; MAN ABOUT TOWN; MUCK ABOUT; \\nNOSE ABOUT (AROUND); NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT; ORDER SOMEONE ABOUT; \\nOUT AND ABOUT; SEE ABOUT; SEND SOMEONE ABOUT SOMEONE\\'S BUSINESS; \\nSET ABOUT; THAT\\'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT; UP AND ABOUT; WHAT ABOUT \\nSOMEONE (SOMETHING). \\nabout time \\nLong past the right time; also, approximately the right time. Thus, It\\'s about time \\nyou went to bed  can mean either that you should have gone to bed much earlier \\n(often stated with emphasis on the word time), or that now is the appropriate time \\nfor you to retire. [Early 1900s] For a synonym, see HIGH TIME. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n2 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMabout to \\n1. Ready to, on the verge of, as in I was about to leave when it began to rain,  or \\nHe hasn\\'t finished yet but he\\'s about to.  This usage was first recorded in Miles \\nCoverdale\\'s 1535 translation of the Bible (Joshua 18:8). 2. not about to.  Having \\nno intention of doing something, as in The shop steward was not about to cross \\nthe picket line,  or Are you staying longer? ?\\nNo, I\\'m not about to.  [Colloquial; first half of 1900s] \\nabove \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ABOVE, also see ALL (NONE) OF \\nTHE ABOVE; CUT ABOVE; HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE; OVER AND ABOVE. \\nabove all \\nMore than anything else, as in A winter hike calls for good equipment, but above \\nall it requires careful planning.  This phrase first appears in William Langland\\'s Piers \\nPloughman  (1377), in which the narrator exhorts readers to love the Lord God \\nabove all. Also see FIRST AND LAST. \\nabove and beyond \\nMore than is required. This somewhat redundant expression?\\nabove and beyond here both denote excess?\\noften precedes the call of duty,  which means exceeding what a particular job \\nrequires. Thus Putting in overtime without pay is above and beyond the call of \\nduty. Also see OVER AND ABOVE. \\naboveboard \\nhand. see OPEN AND ABOVEBOARD. \\nabove suspicion \\nSo trustworthy as never to be suspected of wrongdoing, as in \"The wife of Caesar \\nmust be above suspicion\" (Charles Merivale, A History of the Romans under the \\nEmpire, 1850). The phrase was given further currency when it was used for the \\ntitle of a very popular World War II spy film starring Joan Crawford ( Above \\nSuspicion,  1943). A similar idiom using above in the sense of \"beyond\" is above \\nthe law, usually describing an individual or business behaving as though exempt \\nfrom rules or laws that apply to others. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n3 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMabove the law \\nhand. see under ABOVE SUSPICION. \\nabsence \\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with ABSENCE, also see \\nCONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE. \\nabsence makes the heart grow fonder \\nSeparation intensifies love, as in After a year in another country she accepted his \\nproposal, so I guess absence makes the heart grow fonder,  or, used ironically, The \\nboss leaves earlier every day; oh well, absence makes the heart grow fonder.\\nAlthough versions of this saying date from Roman times, it only became popular \\nafter Thomas Haynes Bayly used it as the last line of a song in The Isle of Beauty \\n(1850). The opposite sentiment is expressed by FAMILIARITY BREEDS \\nCONTEMPT. \\nabsent without leave \\nAway without permission or explanation, as in Her daughter went to the mall but \\ngot in trouble for being absent without leave.  The term and its acronym, AWOL,\\noriginated in the American military during World War I for soldiers absent from \\nduty without permission (leave). It later was transferred to civilian situations, as in \\nJohn didn\\'t just cut his Tuesday classes; he went AWOL. \\naccidentally on purpose \\nhand. see ON PURPOSE, def. 2. \\naccord \\nhand. see OF ONE\\'S OWN ACCORD. \\naccording to all accounts \\nhand. see BY ALL ACCOUNTS. \\naccording to Hoyle \\nIn keeping with established rules; on the highest authority, as in The tax records \\nare in excellent order, all according to Hoyle.  Edmond Hoyle (1679-1769) of \\nEngland, author of books of rules for card games, was so highly regarded that \\nnumerous writers used his name on their own rule books, even for games that file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n4 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMhad not been invented by the time of Hoyle\\'s death, so that his name became \\nsynonymous with any rules. \\naccount \\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with ACCOUNT, also see ALL \\nPRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR; BY ALL ACCOUNTS; CALL TO ACCOUNT; GIVE A\\nGOOD ACCOUNT; NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES; ON ACCOUNT OF; ON NO \\nACCOUNT; ON ONE\\'S OWN ACCOUNT; ON SOMEONE\\'S ACCOUNT; TAKE \\nACCOUNT OF; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT; TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT. \\naccount for \\n1. Be the determining factor in; cause. For example, The beat wave accounts for \\nall this food spoilage, or Icy roads account for the increase in accidents. 2. Explain\\nor justify, as in Jane was upset because her son couldn\\'t account for the three \\nhours between his last class and his arrival at home.  Both of these related usages \\nare derived from the literal meaning of the phrase, that is, \"make a reckoning of \\nan account.\" [Second half of 1700s] \\naccustomed to \\nUsed to something or someone; having the habit of doing something. For \\nexample, In Spain we gave up our usual schedule and became accustomed to \\neating dinner at 10 P.M.  Professor Higgins in the musical My Fair Lady  (1956) \\nruefully sang the song \"I\\'ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face\" after his protege \\nEliza walked out on him. [Second half of 1400s] \\nace \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ACE, also see HOLD ALL THE \\nACES; WITHIN AN ACE OF. \\nace in the hole \\nA hidden advantage or resource kept in reserve until needed, as in The prosecutor\\nhad an ace in the hole: an eyewitness.  The term comes from stud poker, where\\neach player is dealt one card face down?\\nthe so-called hole card?\\nand the rest face up. Should the hole card be an ace, the player has a hidden \\nadvantage. Hole here simply means \"a hiding place.\" In the 19th-century American\\nWest, the expression was used to refer to a hidden weapon, such as a gun file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n5 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMconcealed in a shoulder holster. By the 1920s it had become a metaphor for any \\nsurprise advantage or leverage. \\nace it \\nAccomplish something with success, as in I\\'m sure he\\'ll ace it when he takes that \\nbar exam.  The verb ace originated in tennis with the meaning \"to hit an \\nunreturnable serve against an opponent.\" The idiom ace it, however, originated \\nas student slang for getting an \"A\" on an exam or in a course but soon was \\nextended to other successful accomplishments. [Slang; mid-1900s] \\nace out \\n1. Get the better of, defeat, as in Our team is bound to ace them out,  or Those \\ncalculus problems aced me out again.  [Slang; mid-1900s] 2. Take advantage of or\\ncheat someone, as in John thought they were trying to ace him out of his \\npromised promotion.  [Slang; c. 1920] \\nAchilles\\' heel \\nA fatal weakness, a vulnerable area, as in This division, which is rarely profitable, \\nis the company\\'s Achilles\\' heel.  The term alludes to the Greek legend about the \\nheroic warrior Achilles whose mother tried to make him immortal by holding the \\ninfant by his heel and dipping him into the River Styx. Eventually he was killed by \\nan arrow shot into his undipped heel. [c. 1800] \\nacid test \\nA decisive trial to determine worth or quality, as in Exposure to brilliant sunlight is \\nthe acid test for showing this fabric won\\'t fade.  Alluding to a 19th-century \\nchemical test for distinguishing gold from other metals, this term was used \\nfiguratively by the early 1900s. \\nacquaintance \\nhand. see NODDING ACQUAINTANCE; SCRAPE UP AN ACQUAINTANCE. \\nacquired taste \\nSomething one learns to like rather than appreciates immediately. For example, \\nBecause it is so salty, caviar for many individuals is an acquired taste,  or With its \\nlack of decorative detail, this china pattern is definitely an acquired taste.\\n[Mid-1800s] \\nacross file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n6 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AM\\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with ACROSS, also see COME \\nACROSS; CUT ACROSS; GET ACROSS; PUT ACROSS; RUN ACROSS. \\nacross the board \\nApplying to all the individuals in a group, as in They promised us an across-the-board tax cut,  that \\nis, one applying to all taxpayers, regardless of income. This expression comes from horse racing, \\nwhere it refers to a bet that covers all possible ways of winning money on a race: win (first), place \\n(second), or show (third). The board here is the notice-board on which the races and betting odds \\nare listed. Its figurative use dates from the mid-1900s. \\nact \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ACT, also see CATCH IN THE ACT; \\nCLEAN UP (ONE\\'S ACT); DO A DISAPPEARING ACT; GET IN THE ACT; GET ONE\\'S \\nACT TOGETHER; HARD (TOUGH) ACT TO FOLLOW; HIGH-WIRE ACT; IN THE ACT\\nOF; PUT ON AN ACT. \\naction \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ACTION, also see ALL TALK AND NO \\nACTION; PIECE OF THE ACTION; SWING INTO ACTION. \\nactions speak louder than words \\nWhat one does is more important than what one says, as in Politicians need to be reminded that \\nactions speak louder than words.  This statement, a proverb found in many languages, including \\nancient Greek, was first worded in precisely this way in English in Colonial Currency  (1736). Also \\nsee ALL TALK; DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO. \\nactive duty \\nFull-time service, as in Julian is 81, but he still comes to the office every day and is very much on \\nactive duty.  This term comes from the military, where it stands in opposition to reserve, which \\nrefers to troops still in the military but not actively engaged. It is occasionally transferred to civilian \\nmatters as well. [First half of 1800s] \\nact of faith \\nBehavior that shows or tests a person\\'s religious or other convictions, as in Rock climbing with a \\nnew, inexperienced partner was a real act of faith.  The term is a translation of the Portuguese auto \\nda fé, which referred to the sentencing and execution of heretics (often by burning at the stake) \\nduring the Inquisition, when punishing heresy was thought to constitute an assertion of faith. In \\nmodern times it is used for more benign circumstances. [Early 1700s] \\nact of God \\nAn unforeseen and uncontrollable natural event, such as a hurricane, fire, or flood. For example, \\nThe publisher shall publish the work within twelve months except in case of delay caused by acts file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n7 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMof God such as fires or floods or other circumstances beyond its control.  It most often appears in \\nlegal contracts, where it is used to indemnify one party against a disaster that prevents it from \\ncarrying out the contract\\'s terms. [Mid-1800s] \\nact on \\n1. Also, act upon.  Conduct oneself in accordance with or as a result of information or another \\naction, as in I will act on my lawyer\\'s advice,  or The manager refused to act upon the hotel guest\\'s \\ncomplaints.  [c. 1800] 2. Influence or affect, as in The baby\\'s fussing acted on the sitter\\'s nerves.\\n[c. 1800] \\nact one\\'s age \\nBehave more maturely. Although the phrase often is used in asking children to act in a more \\ngrown-up fashion ( Only babies suck their thumbs; act your age ), it also may refer to an adult who \\nis, sometimes deliberately, acting much younger than might be considered appropriate ( Grandpa, \\nit\\'s time you stopped climbing ladders and acted your age ). \\nact out \\n1. Perform or portray something or someone, as in As she read to the class, the teacher had each \\nchild act out a different character in the story.  [c. 1600] 2. Express unconscious feelings or \\nimpulses through one\\'s behavior, without being aware of it. For example, She acted out her anger \\nat her father by screaming at her husband.  This meaning comes from 20th-century psychological \\ntheory and usually (but not always) refers to negative or hostile impulses and emotions. The term \\nis sometimes used without an object to mean \"misbehave\" or \"behave disruptively,\" as in The child \\nis acting out in class. [First half of 1900s] In both usages, out means \\'\\'openly\" or \"publicly.\" \\nact up \\n1. Misbehave. For example, With an inexperienced rider, this horse always acts up.  [c. 1900] 2. \\nMalfunction, as in I\\'m not sure what\\'s wrong with my car, but the transmission is acting up.  In both\\nusages up means \"abnormally.\" \\nact upon \\nhand. see ACT ON. \\nAdam \\nhand. see NOT KNOW FROM ADAM. \\nadd fuel to the fire Also, add fuel to the flames.  Worsen an already bad situation, as by \\nincreasing anger, hostility, or passion, as in Bill was upset, and your making fun of his mishap just \\nadded fuel to the fire.  This metaphor dates from Roman times?\\nLivy used it in his history of Rome?\\nand it remains in common use. For similar metaphors, see ADD INSULT TO INJURY; FAN \\nTHE FLAMES. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n8 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMadd insult to injury \\nHurt a person\\'s feelings after doing him or her harm; also, make a bad situation worse. For \\nexample, \\nNot only did the club refuse him, but it published a list of the rejected applicants ?\\nthat\\'s adding insult to injury,  or The nearest parking space was half a mile away, and then, to add \\ninsult to injury, it began to pour.  The phrase is an ancient one, even older than its often cited use \\nin the Roman writer Phaedrus\\'s fable of the bald man and the fly. A fly bit the head of a bald man, \\nwho, trying to crush it, gave himself a heavy blow. The fly then jeered, \"You want to avenge an \\ninsect\\'s sting with death; what will you do to yourself, who have added insult to injury?\" In English \\nit was first recorded in 1748. \\naddition \\nhand. see IN ADDITION. \\nadd up \\n1. Amount to an expected or correct total, as in These figures don\\'t add up,  meaning they are not \\ncorrect. [Mid-1800s] 2. Be consistent, make sense, as in I\\'m not sure that all this testimony will \\nadd up. [First half of 1900s] 3. Assess, form an opinion of, as in He looked across the track and \\nadded up the competition.  Also see ADD UP TO. \\nadd up to \\nAmount to, signify, as in The smooth airline connections, luxury hotel, and fine weather added up \\nto the best vacation we\\'d ever had.

In a great hurry, as fast as possible, as in With her term \\npaper due on Monday, she was racing against the clock to finish it,  or They were working against \\ntime to stay on schedule.

Its figurative use dates from the mid-1900s. \\nagainst the grain \\nOpposed to one\\'s inclination or preference, as in We followed the new supervisor\\'s advice, though \\nit went against the grain.

In the poem a sailor does kill an albatross, and when the ship then is becalmed \\nnear the equator and runs out of water, his shipmates blame him and force him to wear the dead \\nbird around his neck. \\naleck \\nhand. see SMART ALECK. \\nalert \\nhand. see ON THE ALERT. \\na little \\n1.

Originating in the late 1960s with reference to launching space missiles \\nand vehicles, this expression has been transferred to general use. \\nall talk (and no action) \\nMuch discussion but no action or results, as in Don\\'t count on Mary\\'s help ?\\nshe\\'s all talk,  or Dave has been saying for months that he\\'ll get a summer job, but he\\'s all talk and \\nno action.  This idiom may have begun life as all talk and no cider, which Washington Irving cited\\nas an American proverb in Salmagundi  (1807). However, similar sayings antedate it by many\\nyears?\\nfor example, \"The greatest talkers are always the least doers\" (John Ray, English Proverbs,  1670). file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n21 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMall that \\n1.

Even, more so, as in Painting the room white will make it all the lighter,  or They liked her all the \\nbetter for not pretending,  or You don\\'t care for dessert? Good, all the more for us.

The current or latest fashion, with the implication that it will be \\nshort-lived, as in In the 1940s the lindy-hop was all the rage.

[Late 1700s] These terms are heard \\nless often today than the synonym THE THING. \\nall there \\nHaving one\\'s wits about one, mentally competent, as in John may seem absentminded, but believe \\nme, be\\'s all there.

This proverbial expression is sometimes phrased be all things to all \\nmen, but today men is often replaced by people to avoid gender discrimination. The expression \\noriginated in Paul\\'s statement (I Corinthians 9:22): \"I am made all things to all men, that I might \\nby all means save some.\" Today it often appears in a political context, but phrased negatively, as in\\nHe wants to be a good school committe member, but be can\\'t be all things to all people. \\nall thumbs \\nPhysically awkward, especially with respect to the hands, as in When it comes to knitting, Mary is \\nall thumbs.

For example, The home team knew it was all up when their star \\nquarterback was injured,  or The party lost their way over a week ago and in this sub-zero weather \\nI\\'m sure it\\'s all up with them.  This idiom uses up in the sense of \"finished.\" [Early 1700s] Also see \\nALL OVER, def. 4. \\nall very well \\nAll right or quite true as far as it goes. For example, It\\'s all very well for Jane to drop out, but how \\nwill we find enough women to make up a team?

Also see WELL AND GOOD. \\nall well and good \\nhand. see WELL AND GOOD. \\nall wet \\nCompletely wrong, mistaken, as in If you think you can beat the system and win at roulette, you\\'re\\nall wet. The original allusion in this expression is unclear, that is, how moisture or dampness is \\nrelated to wrongness. [Slang; first half of 1900s] \\nall wool and a yard wide \\nGenuine, not fake; of excellent quality; also, honorable. For example, You can count on Ned ?\\nbe\\'s all wool and a yard wide.

[Late 1800s] \\nall work and no play (makes Jack a dull boy) \\nHard work without time for recreation is not good for one\\'s health, as in If Harry keeps up that \\ngrueling schedule, be\\'s beaded for a breakdown ?\\nall work and no play isn\\'t healthy.  A proverb included in James Howell\\'s collection of 1659, this \\nphrase remains so familiar that it is often shortened, as in the example. \\nall year round \\nThroughout the entire year, without regard to seasons. For example, Thanks to the indoor courts \\nwe can play tennis all year round.  [Mid-1700s] \\nalma mater Also, Alma Mater.

For example, We \\ntold the architect we want a design along the lines of his own house but smaller,  or Jane asked the\\ncaterer for a menu on the lines of the Morgans\\' wedding reception.  This idiom uses line in the \\nsense of \"a direction or procedure,\" a usage dating from the early 1600s. \\nalong with \\n1.

For example, Mary planned her day as follows: \\nreturning all phone calls; a department meeting; lunch with her colleagues; library research.  This \\nterm is always put in the singular (\"follows\") even though it applies to numerous items and is \\nfrequently followed by a colon. It was first recorded in 1548. \\nas for Also, as to. With regard to, concerning. For example, As for dessert, I\\'d better skip it today\\nand We are not sure as to how to pay the bill.  A particularly well-known use of this idiom is in \\nPatrick Henry\\'s speech before the Virginia Convention in 1775: \"As for me, give me liberty or give file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n35 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMme death.\" Also see \\nAS TO. \\nas good as \\nhand. see GOOD AS. \\naside \\nhand. see ALL JOKING ASIDE; LAY ASIDE; SET ASIDE; TAKE ASIDE. \\naside from \\nhand. see under APART FROM. \\nas if Also, as though. As it would be, as in He decided to accept, as if it really mattered,\\nor John scowled a s though he were really angry.  The first idiom dates from the late 1500s, the \\nvariant from the late 1700s. Also see MAKE AS IF.\\nas I live and breathe \\nFor sure, definitely, as in As I live and breathe, I\\'ve never seen a more beautiful view.  This \\nexpression is generally used to emphasize the truth of a statement and has been so used since the \\nmid-1600s, although sometimes it was put simply as as I live.  However, the complete phrase was \\nalso used early on, as in Arthur Murphy\\'s 1756 play The Apprentice  (2:1): \"As I live and breathe, \\nwe shall both be taken, for heaven\\'s sake let us make our escape.\" \\nas is \\nJust the way it is, with no changes. For example, We saved a few dollars by buying the floor \\nsample on an as is basis.  This expression is used of goods to be sold that may be slightly worn, \\ndamaged, or otherwise less than perfect. \\nas it were \\nSeemingly, in a way, as in He was living in a dream world, as it were.  A shortening of \"as if it were \\nso,\" this idiom has been in use since Chaucer\\'s time (he had it in his Nun\\'s Priest\\'s Tale,  c. 1386). \\nAlso see so TO SPEAK. \\nask \\nhand.

To persist in an action despite the likelihood that it will bring trouble on \\noneself, as in Speeding as much as he does, he has been asking for a ticket  and Mary deserved \\nthat low grade; in effect, she asked for it by not studying.  [c. 1900] Also see ASK FOR THE \\nMOON. \\nask for the moon \\nMake an unreasonable demand, request the unattainable, as in $1,000 for her birthday? Mary \\nmight as well be asking for the moon.  This hyperbolic idiom appeared in the mid-1800s in slightly \\ndifferent form. Charles Dickens had it as cry for the moon  (in Bleak House,  1852) and William \\nMakepeace Thackeray as wish for the moon (in Lovell the Widower,  1860). Today ask is the \\nmost common version. \\nask out \\nInvite someone to something, such as dinner, the theater, or a date. For example, We\\'ve been \\nasked out to dinner twice this week,  or Mary felt shy about asking John out.  [Late 1800s] \\nasleep \\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with ASLEEP, also see FALL ASLEEP. \\nasleep at the switch Also, asleep at the wheel.  Inattentive, not doing one\\'s job, as in At the \\ncritical moment the watchman was asleep at the switch and only called the fire department when it\\nwas too late.  This term came from 19th-century American railroading, when it was the trainman\\'s \\nduty to switch cars from one track to another by means of manually operated levers. Should he fail\\nto do so, trains could collide. It was later transferred to any lack of alertness. The wheel in the \\nvariant is a steering wheel; similarly disastrous results are implied. \\nas likely as not \\nsee LIKE AS NOT. \\nas long as \\n1. For the period of time that, as in You may keep the book as long as you want,  that is, keep it for \\nwhatever time you wish to. [Early 1400s] 2. Also, so long as.  Since, because, as in Please pick up \\nsome milk as long as you are going to the store,  or So long as you\\'re here, you might as well stay \\nfor dinner. \\n3. Also, so long as; just so.  Provided that, as in As long as you don\\'t expect it by tomorrow, I\\'ll \\nmake the drawing,  or So long as sales are greater than returns, the company will make a profit,  or \\nYou may have another cookie, just so you don\\'t take the last one.  [Early 1800s] \\nas luck would have it \\nHow things turned out, as it happened, as in As luck would have it he missed his train,  or The file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n37 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMcheck arrived in time, as luck would have it.  The luck referred to can mean either good fortune or \\nbad. [Late 1500s] \\nas many \\n1. The same number of. For example, He changed jobs four times in as many years  means he \\nchanged jobs four times in four years. [c. 1400] 2. as many as.  A phrase used to qualify the \\nmeaning of many as a very large number, depending on what follows it. For example, You can take\\nas many pens as you need.  [Late 1300s] Also see AS . . . AS; AS MUCH AS. \\nas much \\nThe same or virtually the same. For example, He\\'s resigning? I thought as much  means I thought \\nhe was doing just that. [Late 1300s] Also see AS MUCH AS. \\nas much as \\n1. The same quantity as. As with AS MANY (def. 2), the meaning of much as a large \\namount here is qualified by what follows. For example, Please help yourself to as \\nmuch of the meat as you want indicates whatever amount you wish. [Late 1100s] \\n2. Also, however much, much as.  Even though, no matter how much, as in As \\nmuch as I hate to, I must stay home tonight,  or However much it hurts, you ought\\nto admit you were wrong,  or Much as Karen would love to see us, she can\\'t get \\nout of her prior commitment.  [Late 1500s] 3. Also, so much as.  In effect, nearly \\nthe same as, as in Mom as much as told Jane she couldn\\'t go,  or The clerk so \\nmuch as accused the customer of shoplifting.  These expressions intensify the \\nmeaning of the verb and indicate that the action is unexpected. [Late 1300s] \\nas of \\nFrom, at, or until a given time. For example, As of five o\\'clock the store will be closed for inventory,\\nor As of last December our meetings have been open to the public,  or As of now I\\'m not sure how \\nI\\'ll vote. This idiom was first used in business but came into more general use. [c. 1900] \\nas one Also, as one man or woman. All together, unanimously. For example, The \\nmarchers shouted as one , \"We shall overcome!\"  or They replied as one woman, \"Of course we\\'ll\\nstay and help.\"  This term appeared in the Bible (Judges 20:8): \"And all the people arose as one\\nman.\\'\\' [Late 1500s] For synonyms, see TO A MAN; WITH ONE VOICE.\\nas regards \\nhand. see IN REGARD TO. \\nass \\nhand.

Be (or get) in trouble, in a painfully \\nawkward position, as in When the news about the slump in sales gets out he\\'ll have his ass in a \\nsling. Probably originating in the American South, this idiom may refer to so vigorous a kick in the \\nbuttocks (for which ass is a rude synonym) that the injured person requires a sling of the kind used\\nto support a broken arm. [Vulgar slang; c. 1930] \\nas soon \\nhand. see AS SOON AS; JUST AS SOON. \\nas soon as \\n1. When, just after, as in Please call me as soon as dinner is ready,  or As soon as the sun goes \\ndown, the temperature drops dramatically.  [Late 1200s] 2. At the earliest moment that, as in \\nTelephone me as soon as you can.  It often takes the form as soon as possible,  meaning at the \\nearliest possible moment, as in He\\'ll finish the work as soon as possible.  This expression employs \\npossible in the sense of \"if it can or could be,\" a usage dating from the late 1600s. \\nas such \\n1. In itself, as in The job as such was easy, but required a lot of time.  [Mid-1600s] 2. In that \\ncapacity, as in In the director\\'s absence the assistants, as such, were in charge.  [c. 1700] \\nas the crow flies \\nIn a straight line, by the shortest route, as in It\\'s only a mile as the crow flies, but about three \\nmiles by this mountain road.  This idiom is based on the fact that crows, very intelligent birds, fly \\nstraight to the nearest food supply. [Late 1700s] \\nas though \\nhand. see AS IF. \\nas to \\n1. According to, as in They were asked to sort the costumes as to color.  [Mid-1700s] 2. See AS \\nFOR. \\nastray \\nhand. see BEST-LAID PLANS GO ASTRAY; GO ASTRAY. \\nas usual \\nIn the normal, habitual, or accustomed way, as in As usual, he forgot to put away the milk.

In addition, besides, also. For example, Mary is going to Italy and to France as well,  or A fine \\nconductor, he plays the violin as well.  [1300s] 2. With an equal or similar result, as in Since he \\ncan\\'t get there in time, he might as well stay at home,  or It\\'s just as well that you came today, \\nsince Harry is here, too.  [1400s] \\nas well as \\n1. In as satisfactory or good a way as. For example, After the operation, she was supposed to walk\\naround as well as she could without limping.  [c. 1400] 2. To the same extent as, as much as. For \\nexample, He is an excellent teacher as well as being a fine musician.  [c. 1440] 3. In addition to, as \\nin The editors as well as the proofreaders are working overtime.  [c. 1700] \\nas yet \\nSo far, up to now, as in No one has found a solution as yet.  [Late 1300s] \\nas you please \\n1. However you wish, whatever you choose, as in We can have meat or fish tonight, as you please,\\nor Go or don\\'t go ?\\ndo as you please.  This idiom was introduced about 1500 and inverted what was then the usual \\norder, which was \"as it pleases you.\" 2. Very, extremely, as in After winning the contract he was \\nsmug as you please,  or She sat there in her new dress, as pretty as you please.  [First half of \\n1900s] \\nat about \\nAt approximately, as in We\\'ll start at about nine.  This phrase, most often used with respect to time \\n(as at about four o\\'clock ), is sometimes criticized for being redundant. Although one of the two\\nwords sometimes can be omitted without changing the meaning?\\nfor example, About four o\\'clock is when most guests will arrive ?\\nin other instances both are needed, as in This stock is now selling at about its original offering \\nprice. [Early 1800s] \\nat a discount \\nAt a lower than usual price; also, held in low esteem. For example, I\\'m holding off on buying a \\ncomputer until I can get one at a discount,  or Liberals are at a discount in the present \\nadministration. The first usage, mainly found in business and commerce, dates from about 1700. \\nThe figurative usage is about a century newer. \\nat all \\n1. In any way or manner, as in Is she able to sing at all? 2. To any extent, as in Was she at all \\nsurprised? 3. For any reason, as in Why bother at all? 4. In the slightest degree, under any \\ncircumstances, as in She simply refused to walk at all.  This construction often occurs in the \\nnegative, as in He was not at all frightened.  All four senses of this phrase date from the mid-1300s.\\nat all costs Also, at any cost or price. Regardless of the expense or effort involved, by file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n40 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMany means. For example , Ann told the doctor to preserve her mother\\'s sight at all costs,  or It \\nseems the company plans to develop the product at any cost,  or I\\'m determined to get vacation \\ntime at any price.  [Mid-1800s]\\nat all times \\nContinuously, without interruption, as in At the airport Mary was warned to keep her carry-on bag \\nin sight at all times. \\nat a loss \\n1. Below cost, as in The store was doing so badly that it was selling merchandise at a loss. 2.\\nPuzzled, perplexed, in a state of uncertainty, as in When his letters were returned unopened, John \\nwas at a loss as to what to do next.  This usage was originally applied to hounds who had lost the \\nscent or track of their prey. [Mid-1600s] 3. at a loss for words.  Unable or uncertain as to what to\\nsay. For example, Father\\'s tirade left us all at a loss for words.  [Late 1600s] \\nat a low ebb \\nAt a low point, in a state of decline or depression. For example, The current recession has put our \\nbusiness at a low ebb.  This idiom transfers the low point of a tide to a decline in human affairs. \\n[Mid1600s] \\nat any cost Also, at any price. \\n hand. See AT ALL COSTS .\\nat any rate\\nIn any event, whatever the case may be; also, at least. For example, At any rate, I promise to be \\nthere even if I\\'m a little late,  or It may not pay well, but at any rate it\\'s a job.  [Early 1600s] Also \\nsee IN ANY CASE. \\nat a premium \\nAt a higher price than usual owing to scarcity; also, considered more valuable, held in high esteem.\\nFor example, Since that article came out, the firm\\'s stock has been selling at a premium  and Space \\nis at a premium in most stores.  This idiom uses premium in the sense of \"bounty\" or \"bonus.\" \\n[Mid-1800s] Also see PUT A PREMIUM ON. \\nat arm\\'s length \\nAt a distance, avoiding intimacy or familiarity, as in Bill hated seeing his colleagues outside the \\noffice, preferring to keep all of them at arm\\'s length,  or She was friendly only when he was safely \\nat arm\\'s length.  Now often used with the verb keep, this term for distancing oneself from a person,\\norganization, or issue originated as at arm\\'s end  but developed its current form by the mid-1600s. \\nat a sitting \\nAt one time, during one period. For example, The cruise ship could feed about 500 passengers at a\\nsitting, or We read the entire poem at a sitting.  Since the word sitting implies just that posture, the\\nterm means \"during a period when one is seated and engaged in a single continuous activity.\" file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n41 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMat a stretch Also, at one stretch.  At one time, during one period. For example, Working quickly, \\nshe hoped to finish all the drawings at a stretch.  In contrast to the nearly synonymous  AT A \\nSITTING, this idiom, first recorded in 1774, does not imply being seated while \\nengaging in a single continuous activity. Rather, it transfers the meaning of stretch\\nas \"a continuous length to a continuous time period.\" \\nat a time \\nhand. see AT ONE TIME, def. 1. \\nat a word \\nIn immediate response, at an instant. For example, At a word from the captain they lined up in \\norder. [c. 1300] \\nat bat \\nTaking one\\'s turn. For example, At this conference, with so many interruptions, it\\'s hard to tell \\nwhich speaker is at bat,  or I was nervous while waiting to testify, but once at bat I felt better.  This \\nidiom, from baseball, was already being transferred to other enterprises by the 1880s. Also see ON\\nDECK. \\nat bay \\nCornered, in distress, as in Angry bystanders chased the thief into an alley and held him at bay \\nuntil the police arrived.  This idiom originally came from hunting, where it describes an animal that \\nhas been driven back and now faces pursuing hounds. Its use for other situations dates from the \\nlate 1500s. \\nat best \\nUnder the most favorable circumstances, as in At best we\\'ll be just one week behind schedule,  or \\nCleaning out the attic is a tedious job at best.  This idiom, formerly also put as at the best, today \\nis most often used in situations that are actually far from ideal, as in the examples above. [First \\nhalf of 1300s] For an antonym, see AT WORST. \\nat bottom \\nFundamentally, basically; also, in reality. For example, He may speak somewhat bluntly, but at \\nbottom he\\'s always honest.  Charles Dickens used this idiom in Nicholas Nickleby  (1838): \"He\\'s a \\ngood pony at bottom.\" [Early 1700s] \\nat close quarters \\nCrowded, in a confined space, as in We could use a lot more room; this tiny office puts us at close \\nquarters. This idiom makes figurative use of quarters in the sense of \"military lodgings\" but \\noriginated in 18th-century naval warfare. When the enemy boarded a ship, the crew would retreat \\nbehind wooden barriers erected for this purpose and would continue to fire through loopholes. \\nThey thus were very near the enemy, fighting in close quarters.  [c. 1800] file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n42 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMat close range \\nVery nearby, as in At close range, the rock band was unbearably loud.  Derived from\\nshooting? range \\ndenotes the distance that missile or projectile can be made to travel?\\nthis expression soon came to mean anything in close proximity. \\nat cross purposes \\nWith aims or goals that conflict or interfere with one another, as in I\\'m afraid the two departments \\nare working at cross purposes.  This idiom, first recorded in 1688, may have begun as a \\n17th-century parlor game called \"cross-purposes,\" in which a series of subjects (or questions) were\\ndivided from their explanations (or answers) and distributed around the room. Players then created\\nabsurdities by combining a subject taken from one person with an explanation taken from another. \\nat death\\'s door \\nOn the point of dying, very ill, as in Whenever she had a bad cold she acted as though she were at\\ndeath\\'s door.  The association of death with an entry way was first made in English in the late \\n1300s, and the phrase itself dates from the mid-1500s. Today it is often used as an exaggeration \\nof ill health. \\nat each other\\'s throats \\nArguing or fighting. For example, It was a very dramatic trial, with the prosecutor and the defense \\nattorney constantly at each other\\'s throats.  This idiom, with its vivid image of two persons trying to\\nstrangle each other, is often applied to less physical forms of disagreement. \\nat ease \\n1. Also, at one\\'s ease.  Comfortable, relaxed, unembarrassed, as in I always feel at ease in my \\ngrandmother\\'s house.  The related idiom put at ease  means \"make comfortable, reassure,\" as in I \\nwas worried that the letter would not arrive in time, but the postmaster put me at ease.  [1300s] \\nFor the antonym, see ILL AT EASE. 2. In a relaxed position in military ranks. The \\nphrase is often used as a command for troops standing at attention to relax, as in \\nAt ease, squadron.  The command stand at ease is slightly different. A British \\nmilitary dictionary of 1802 described it as standing with the right foot drawn back \\nabout six inches and one\\'s weight put on it. An American version is to stand with \\none\\'s feet slightly apart and the hands clasped behind one\\'s back. \\nat every turn \\nEverywhere; also, continually, at every moment. For example, He found trash strewn about at \\nevery turn,  or Life holds surprises at every turn.  The turn here does not signify change of direction \\nbut change of circumstances, and the phrase generally is something of an exaggeration. [Late \\n1500s] \\nat face value, take file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n43 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMAccept from its outward appearance, as in You can\\'t always take a manufacturer\\'s advertisements \\nat face value; they\\'re bound to exaggerate.  Literally this id\\niom has referred to the monetary value printed on a bank note, stock certificate, bond, or other \\nfinancial instrument since the 1870s. The figurative usage is from the late 1800s. \\nat fault \\nResponsible for a mistake, trouble, or failure; deserving blame. For example, At least three cars \\nwere involved in the accident, so it was hard to determine which driver was at fault,  or He kept \\nmissing the target and wondered if the sight on his new rifle was at fault.  In Britain this usage was \\nformerly considered incorrect but is now acceptable; in America it has been widespread since the \\nmid-1800s. Also see IN THE WRONG. \\nat first \\nInitially, at the start, as in At first the berries were green, but when they ripened they turned bright\\nred. [Second half of 1500s] \\nat first blush Also, at first glance  or sight. When first seen. For example, At first blush we \\nthought it was an elegant restaurant, but it soon became obvious that it was hardly the place for a \\nspecial dinner,  or At first glance the contract looked just fine.  All three phrases date from the \\n1300s. The noun blush is used with the obsolete meaning \"glimpse\" or \"momentary view\" and in \\nthis idiom has nothing to do with showing embarrassment. Also see LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. \\nat first hand \\nDirectly from the origin, without intervention or intermediary. For example, I prefer to hear his \\ncriticism at first hand, rather than having it passed on by my boss.  This phrase uses hand in the \\nsense of \"person\" (coming directly from one person).

[First half of 1800s] \\nat loggerheads \\nEngaged in a quarrel or dispute, as in The two families were always at loggerheads, making it \\ndifficult to celebrate holi\\ndays together.  This term may have come from some earlier meaning of loggerhead,  referring either \\nto a blockhead or stupid person, or to a long-handled iron poker with a bulb-shaped end that was \\nheated in the fire and used to melt pitch. If it was the latter, it may have been alluded to as a \\nweapon.

In a state of inactivity or repose, either physical or mental. For example, The doctor\\'s clear \\nexplanation put her mind at rest.  Chaucer used this idiom in Troilus and Cressida  (c. 1374): \"I mine \\nheart set at rest upon this point.\" Also see LAY AT REST. 2.  Dead, as in His soul is now at \\nrest with his forebears.

For example, At this point she is by far the best \\nathlete on the circuit  implies that she may not have been the best in the past or\\nmay not be in the future. Similarly, Buying a new car seems prudent at this \\njuncture indicates that this purchase may not have been wise in the past and mayfile:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n53 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMnot be at some future time.

Chaucer used this sense in Troilus and \\nCressida: \"For at the worst, it may yet short our way.\" [Late 1300s] For the antonym, see AT file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n54 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMBEST. \\naugur well for Also, augur ill for; bode well  or ill for.

He \\nworked hard until the school bell rang, whereupon the man, instead of thanking the boy, began to \\nscold him for being late and told him to hurry to school. \"Having an ax to grind\" then came into \\nfigurative use for having a personal motive for some action.

Also see BACK OF BEYOND. \\nback of beyond \\nExtremely remote.

Back to the beginning because the \\ncurrent attempt was unsuccessful, as in When the town refused to fund our music program, we \\nhad to go back to the drawing board,  or I\\'ve assembled this wrong side up, so it\\'s back to square \\none. The first term originated during World War II, most likely from the caption of a cartoon by \\nPeter Arno in The New Yorker  magazine. It pictured a man who held a set of blueprints and was \\nwatching an airplane explode. The variant is thought to come from a board game or street game \\nwhere an unlucky throw of dice or a marker sends the player back to the beginning of the course. \\nIt was popularized by British sports-casters in the 1930s, when the printed radio program included \\na grid with numbered squares to help listeners follow the description of a soccer game. \\nback to the salt mines \\nResume work, usually with some reluctance, as in With my slavedriver of a boss, even on \\nSaturdays it\\'s back to the salt mines.

Although egg had been used for various kinds of person (young, good, bad)\\nsince Shakespeare\\'s day, this transfer of a seemingly wholesome food that, when opened, turns \\nout to be rotten took place only in the mid-1800s.

The verb to bait has meant to supply a hook or trap with a morsel of food so as to attract a \\nfish or animal since about 1300; the verb to switch has meant to change, alter, or transfer from \\none thing to another since the 1890s. The pairing of the two, however, dates only from the 1920s, \\nalthough the practice is surely much older. It is called switch-selling  in Britain. \\nbaker\\'s dozen \\nThirteen, as in The new bagel store always gives you a baker\\'s dozen.  The origins of this term are \\ndisputed. One theory is that in times when bread was sold by weight, bakers who short-weighted \\ntheir customers were heavily fined, and for safety\\'s sake they would sell thirteen loaves for the \\nprice of twelve. Another theory is that dealers purchasing bread from bakers were allowed by law \\nto receive thirteen loaves for the price of twelve, the thirteenth representing their cut of profit. \\n[Late 1500s] \\nbalance \\nhand.

Cut out the banana oil!  The precise\\nanalogy in this idiom is not clear, unless it is to the fact that banana oil, a paint solvent and artificial \\nflavoring agent, has no relation to the fruit other than that it smells like it. Possibly it is a variation \\non snake oil,  a term for quack medicine that was extended to mean nonsense. [1920s] \\nband \\nhand. see ON THE BANDWAGON; TO BEAT THE BAND. \\nbang \\nhand.

By the late 1600s barefaced  also meant \"brazen\" or \"bold,\" the meaning alluded \\nto in this phrase. \\nbare hands, with one\\'s \\nWith one\\'s hands but without tools, weapons, or other implements.

For example, The room was furnished with just the\\nbare necessities ?\\nbed, table, chair.

For example, Teenagers rarely bare their souls to \\ntheir parents; they prefer their peers.

Indicate hostility and readiness to fight, as in His \\nrefusal to accept my offer made it clear I\\'d have to bare my teeth,  or In this instance, calling in a \\nlawyer is showing one\\'s teeth.

By Shakespeare\\'s time it \\nwas being used figuratively, as it is today.

Some authorities consider this usage colloquial and \\nadvise that it be avoided in formal writing. [Late 1500s] Also see BETTER HALF, def. 1. \\nbetween \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with BETWEEN, also see BETWIXT AND \\nBETWEEN; COME BETWEEN; DRAW A LINE BETWEEN; FALL BETWEEN THE \\nCRACKS; FEW AND FAR BETWEEN; HIT BETWEEN THE EYES; IN BETWEEN; IN \\nBETWEEN TIMES; READ BETWEEN THE LINES; TAIL BETWEEN ONE\\'S LEGS. \\nbetween a rock and a hard place Also, between the devil and the deep blue sea  or Scylla \\nand Charybdis.  Between two equally difficult or unacceptable choices. For example, Trying to \\nplease both my boss and his supervisor puts me between a rock and a hard place.  The rock and \\nhard place  version is the newest of these synonymous phrases, dating from the early 1900s, and \\nalludes to being caught or crushed between two rocks. The oldest is Scylla and Charybdis,  which in\\nHomer\\'s Odyssey signified a monster on a rock (Scylla) and a fatal whirlpool (Charybdis), between \\nwhich Odysseus had to sail through a narrow passage. It was used figuratively by the Roman \\nwriter Virgil and many writers since. The devil in devil and deep blue sea,  according to \\nlexicographer Charles Earle Funk, referred to a seam around a ship\\'s hull near the waterline, which,\\nif a sailor was trying to caulk it in heavy seas, would cause him to fall overboard. Others disagree, \\nhowever, and believe the phrase simply alludes to a choice between hellfire with the devil and \\ndrowning in deep waters. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n90 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMbetween the lines \\nhand. see READ BETWEEN THE LINES. \\nbetween you and me Also, between ourselves; just between you and me and the \\nbedpost or four walls  or gatepost  or lamp\\npost. In strict confidence. For example, Just between you and me, it was Janet who proposed to \\nBill rather than vice versa.  This phrase, dating from about 1300, is generally followed by some \\ninformative statement that the listener is being asked to keep secret. The variant with bedpost,\\nalso shortened to post, dates from the early 1800s; four walls,  also shortened to the wall, dates \\nfrom the early 1900s, as does the gatepost. \\nbetwixt and between  Undecided, midway between two alternatives, neither here nor there. For \\nexample, I\\'m betwixt and between canceling my trip entirely or just postponing it,  or Jane is \\nbetwixt and between about accepting the offer.  The adverb betwixt, originally meaning \"by two,\" is\\nseldom heard except in this expression, first recorded in 1832. \\nbeyond \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with BEYOND, also see ABOVE AND \\nBEYOND; BACK OF BEYOND; CAN\\'T SEE BEYOND THE END OF ONE\\'S NOSE. \\nbeyond a doubt Also, beyond the shadow of a doubt.  Certainly so, undoubtedly so, as in \\nBeyond a doubt this is the best view of the valley.  This phrase, along with the earlier without \\ndoubt (dating from c. 1300), asserts the truth of some statement. W.S. Gilbert\\'s version, in The \\nGondoliers  (1889), is: \"Of that there is no manner of doubt??\\nno probable, possible shadow of doubtno possible doubt whatever.\" In this context shadow means \\n\"a trace or slight suggestion.\" Another variant is beyond a reasonable doubt.  This phrase is \\noften used in court when the judge instructs the jury that they must be convinced of the accused\\'s \\nguilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt; reasonable  here means \"logical and rational.\" Also \\nsee BEYOND QUESTION; NO DOUBT. \\nbeyond comparison Also, without comparison  or beyond compare.  Too superior to be \\ncompared, unrivaled, as in This view of the mountains is beyond comparison,  or That bakery is \\nwithout comparison.  The first term, more common today than the much older variants, was first \\nrecorded in 1871. Without comparison  goes back to 1340, and without compare  to 1621. \\nbeyond measure \\nTo an extreme degree; exceedingly. For example, Her attitude annoys me beyond measure.  This \\nterm was first recorded in 1526. \\nbeyond one\\'s depth \\nhand. see OUT OF ONE\\'S DEPTH. \\nbeyond one\\'s means file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n91 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMToo costly for one, more than one can afford. For example, A second vacation this year is well \\nbeyond our means.  The noun means here signifies \"resources at one\\'s disposal,\" a usage current \\nsince Shakespeare\\'s time, as in Measure for Measure  (2:2): \"Let her have needful, but not lavish \\nmeans.\" [Late 1800s] beyond question Also, beyond all  or without question.  Definitely, \\ncertainly, as in Beyond question he is the best man for the job.  This idiom indicates that something\\nis so sure it cannot be questioned. So used since the late 1500s, it was also put as past question,\\nby Shakespeare and others. Also see BEYOND A DOUBT. \\nbeyond reach \\nhand. see under IN REACH. \\nbeyond recall \\nIrreversible, irretrievable, as in We can\\'t repair this screen ?\\nit\\'s beyond recall,  or It\\'s too late to cancel our plans ?\\nthey\\'re beyond recall.  This idiom employs recall in the sense of revoking or annulling something. \\n[Mid-1600s] \\nbeyond reproach \\nBlameless, faultless, as in Jean\\'s conduct at school is beyond reproach.  The phrase employs the \\nverb to reproach  in the sense of \"censure or rebuke,\" a usage dating from the early 1500s. \\nbeyond the call of duty \\nhand. see under ABOVE AND BEYOND. \\nbeyond the pale \\nOutside the bounds of morality, good behavior or judgment; unacceptable. For example, She \\nthought taking the boys to a topless show was beyond the pale.  The noun pale, from the Latin \\npalum, meant \"a stake for fences\" or \"a fence made from such stakes.\" By extension it came to be \\nused for an area confined by a fence and for any boundary, limit, or restriction, both of these \\nmeanings dating from the late 1300s. The pale referred to in the idiom is usually taken to mean \\nthe English Pale,  the part of Ireland under English rule, and therefore, as perceived by its rulers, \\nwithin the bounds of civilization. \\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt \\nhand. see BEYOND A DOUBT. \\nBible belt \\nAn area noted for religious fundamentalism; specifically, parts of the American South and Midwest. \\nFor example, You wouldn\\'t dare try to sell a sex manual in the Bible belt.  This term alludes to the \\nprevalence of evangelical revivals, strict morals, belief in the literal truth of the Bible, and similar \\ntraits. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n92 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AM[c. 1920] \\nbid adieu \\nSay goodbye, take leave of, as in It\\'s beyond my bedtime, so I bid you all adieu,  or I\\'ll be glad to \\nbid adieu to these crutches.  French for \"goodbye,\" adieu literally means \"to God\" and was part of à\\ndieu vous commant,  \"I commend you to God.\" Adopted into English in the 1300s, it was first \\nrecorded in Chaucer\\'s Troilus and Cressida  (c. 1385). Today it is considered quite formal, although \\nit also is used humorously. \\nbide one\\'s time \\nWait for the opportune moment, as in The cat sat in front of the mousehole, biding its time.  This \\nphrase employs the verb to bide in the sense of \"to wait for,\" a usage dating from about A.D. 950\\nand surviving mainly in this locution. \\nbid up \\nRaise a price by raising one\\'s offer, as in We were hoping to get an Oriental rug cheaply, but the \\ndealer kept bidding us up.  This phrase is used in business and commerce, particularly at auctions. \\n[Mid-1800s] \\nbig \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with BIG, also see GO OVER BIG; GREAT\\n(BIG) GUNS; HIT IT BIG; IN A BIG WAY; LITTLE FROG IN A BIG POND; MAKE A \\nFEDERAL CASE (BIG DEAL); TALK BIG; THINK BIG; TOO BIG FOR ONE\\'S \\nBREECHES; WHAT\\'S THE (BIG) IDEA. Also see under BIGGER. \\nbig and bold \\nLarge and striking, as in His ties tended to be big and bold in color and pattern,  or This big and \\nbold design for a book jacket is sure to catch the casual browser\\'s eye.  This phrase, used mostly to\\ndescribe things rather than persons, is a kind of visual analog of LOUD AND CLEAR. \\nbig as life Also, large as life.  In person, as in And there was Mary, big as life, standing right in \\nfront of me.  This phrase transfers the same size as in real life (life-size) to an actual appearance. \\nSometimes this term is embellished with and quite as natural,  presumably alluding to a likeness \\nof a person or thing that closely resembles the real thing. A similar addition is and twice as \\nnatural, which doesn\\'t make sense. [Late 1800s] 2. Also, larger than life; big as all outdoors.\\nOn a grand scale, as in The soap opera could well be called a larger-than-life drama,  or That friend \\nof his was as big as all outdoors.  This phrase can be used either literally, for larger than life-size \\n(second example) or figuratively. The phrase all outdoors  has been used to compare something or \\nsomeone to an immensity since the early 1800s. \\nbig bucks \\nA great deal of money, as in A swimming pool ?\\nthat means you\\'re spending big bucks. Buck  has been slang for \"dollar\" since the mid-1800s. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n93 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AM[Slang; second half of 1900s] \\nbig cheese Also, big shot or gun or wheel or enchilada.  An important, powerful person; the \\nboss. For example,\\nShe loved being the big cheese of her company; the big guns in Congress are bound to change the\\nPresident\\'s bill; you\\'d better not act like a big shot among your old friends; Harry was the big wheel\\nin his class;  and You\\'ll have to get permission from the big enchilada.  The first term dates from the\\nlate 1800s and its origin is disputed. Some think it comes from the Urdu word chiz or cheez for \\n\"thing,\" but others hold it plays on the English word \"chief.\" Big gun is much older, dating from the\\nearly 1800s; big shot became very popular in the late 1920s, particularly when used for underworld\\nleaders of gangsters; big wheel  dates from about the same period. Big enchilada,  often put as the \\nbig enchilada,  is the newest, dating from the early 1970s.\\nbig daddy \\n1. An influential man, a big shot (see under BIG CHEESE), as in You\\'ll have to get \\npermission from big daddy.  [Slang; mid-1900s] 2. A male sweetheart or friend, \\noften a man considerably older than his female companion; a SUGAR DADDY. \\n[Slang; mid-1900s] 3. Grandfather. This usage originated in the South among \\nAfrican-Americans. 4.

[c. 1940] Also see under MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF. 2. So \\nwhat? Who cares? For example, So you got the job after all ?\\nwell, big deal!  This use of the phrase as an ironic interjection dates from approximately the same \\ntime. \\nbig enchilada \\nhand. see under BIG CHEESE. \\nbig fish in a small pond Also, big frog in a little pond.  A person who is important in a limited \\narena; someone overqualified for a position or in relation to colleagues. For example, Steve has \\nboth a Ph.D. and an M.D., yet he\\'s content with his practice at a rural hospital; he prefers to be a \\nbig fish in a little pond.  The expression big fish has been slang for an important or influential \\nperson since the early 1800s. The addition of in a small pond  as a metaphor for an unimportant \\norganization is more recent, as is the substitution of frog. Another variant is the proverb Better a \\nbig fish in a little puddle than a little fish in a big puddle. \\nbigger \\nhand.

This expression is believed to come from boxing and \\ngained currency when boxer Robert Fitzsimmons used it in a 1902 newspaper interview before \\nfighting the much heavier James J. Jeffries. It was probably derived from similar adages, such as \\n\"The bigger the tree, the harder she falls.\" \\nbig head, have a \\nBe conceited; have an exaggerated sense of one\\'s own importance or ability. For example, The \\nconstant flattery of his subordinates is bound to give Thomas a big head.

For example, \\nBob thinks he might do better in a bigger firm, but his wife insists he should stay, saying a bird in \\nthe hand. \\nThis expression, which in full is A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,  was an ancient \\nGreek proverb. It was well known in English by about 1400 and has been repeated so frequently \\nthat it is often shortened. \\nbird of passage \\nA transient, one who is here today and gone tomorrow. For example, Mary moves nearly every \\nyear; she\\'s a true bird of passage.  This phrase transfers the literal meaning of a migrating bird to \\nhuman behavior. [Second half of 1700s] \\nbirds and the bees, the \\nA euphemism for sex education, especially when taught informally. For example, It\\'s time Father \\ntold the children about the birds and the bees.  Cole Porter alluded to this expression in his witty \\nsong, \"Let\\'s Do It, Let\\'s Fall in Love,\" (1928) when he noted that birds, bees, even educated fleas \\nfall in love. This idiom alludes to sexual behavior in animals to avoid explicit explanation of human \\nbehavior. [Second half of 1800s] \\nbird\\'s eye view \\nAn overview, as in This balcony gives us a bird\\'s eye view of the town,  or This course gives you a \\nbird\\'s eye view of history ?\\nfrom Eolithic man to the Gulf War in one semester.

The full saying in \\nEnglish, Birds of a feather flock together,  was first recorded in 1545. \\nbirth \\nhand. see GIVE BIRTH TO. \\nbirthday suit \\nNakedness, as in The doorbell rang, and here I was in my birthday suit.

Biting one\\'s fingernails is a time-honored sign of emotional tension. The Roman \\nsatirist Horace described it about 35 B.C.: \"As he wrought his verse he would often . . . \\ngnaw his nails to the quick\" ( Satires, Book I). \\nbite one\\'s tongue \\nRefrain from speaking out, as in A new grandmother must learn to bite her tongue so as not to \\ngive unwanted advice,  or I\\'m sure it\\'ll rain during graduation. ?\\nBite your tongue!  This term alludes to holding the tongue between the teeth in an effort not to say \\nsomething one might regret. Shakespeare used it in 2 Henry VI  (1:1): \"So York must sit and fret \\nand bite his tongue.\" Today it is sometimes used as a humorous imperative, as in the second \\nexample, with the implication that speaking might bring bad luck. [Late 1500s] Also see HOLD \\nONE\\'S TONGUE. \\nbite someone\\'s head off Also, snap someone\\'s head off.  Scold or speak very angrily to \\nsomeone, as in Ask her to step down from the board?

Also, Francis Grose\\'s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue  (1796) holds that \\ngrenadiers being disciplined with the cat-o\\'-nine-tails would bite on a bullet to avoid crying out in \\npain. \\nbite the dust \\nSuffer defeat or death, as in The 1990 election saw both of our senators bite the dust.  Although \\nthis expression was popularized by American Western films of the 1930s, in which either cowboys \\nor Indians were thrown from their horses to the dusty ground, it originated much earlier. Tobias \\nSmollett had it in Gil Blas (1750): \"We made two of them bite the dust.\" \\nbite the hand that feeds you \\nShow ingratitude, turn against a benefactor. For example, The college gave me a scholarship, so I \\nshouldn\\'t bite the hand that feeds me and criticize its hiring policies.  Used about 600 B.C. by the \\nGreek poet Sappho, this metaphor of a dog biting its master was first recorded in \\nEnglish in 1711. \\nbitten \\nhand. see ONCE BITTEN, TWICE SHY; also see BITE. \\nbitter \\nhand.

For example, I\\'m supporting the union\\'s demands to the \\nbitter end,  or Even though they fight a lot, I\\'m sure Mom and Dad will stay together to the bitter \\nend. The source of this term may have been nautical, a bitter being a turn of a cable around posts,\\nor bitts, on a ship\\'s deck, and the bitter end  meaning \"the part of the cable that stays inboard.\" \\nThus, when a rope is paid out to the bitter end, no more remains. [Mid-1800s] \\nbitter pill to swallow\\nAn unpleasant fact, disappointment, or humiliation that is difficult to endure.

[Late 1800s] 2. Also, black or white.  Involving a very \\nclear distinction, without any gradations. For example, He tended to view everything as a black and\\nwhite issue ??\\nit was either right or wrongwhereas his partner always found gray areas.  This usage is based on \\nthe association of black with evil and white with virtue, which dates back at least 2,000 years. \\n[Early 1800s] Also see GRAY AREA. 3. in black and white.  Written down or in print, \\nand therefore official. For example, The terms of our agreement were spelled out \\nin black and white, so there should be no question about it.

Totally black; also, very dark. For example, The well \\nwas black as night, or She had eyes that were black as coal.  These similes have survived while\\nothers?\\nblack as ink, a raven, thunder, hell, the devil, my hat, the minister\\'s coat, the ace of spades?\\nare seldom if ever heard today. Of the current objects of comparison, pitch may be the oldest, so \\nused in Homer\\'s Iliad (c. 850 B.C.), and coal is mentioned in a Saxon manuscript from \\nA.D. 1000. John Milton used black as night  in Paradise Lost  (1667). \\nblack book \\n1. A list of persons or things out of favor, as in Tom\\'s in my black book these days.  This usage \\ndates from the 14th century and in time became more ominous. In 1536 the agents of King Henry \\nVIII wrote in a black book the names of those to be censured or punished, \\nspecifically \"sinful\" English monasteries (whose lands Henry wanted to acquire). \\nToday being in someone\\'s black book still signifies being in trouble, at least with \\nthat person. Also see BLACK LIST. 2. Also, little black book.  A personal \\ntelephone directory listing girlfriends, or, less often, boyfriends. For example, Now \\nthat he\\'s engaged to Ellen, Jim won\\'t be needing his little black book.  [1930s] 3.

[c. 1980] \\nblack eye \\nA mark of shame, a humiliating setback, as in That there are enough homeless folks to need \\nanother shelter is a black eye for the administration.  This metaphor alludes to having discolored \\nflesh around the eye resulting from a blow. The term is also used literally, as in The mugger not \\nonly took Bill\\'s wallet but gave him a black eye.

Also Black Monday, Black Tuesday, etc.  A day of economic catastrophe, as in We feared \\nthere\\'d be another Black Friday.  This usage dates from September 24, 1869, a Friday when stock \\nmanipulators Jay Gould and James Fisk tried to corner the gold market and caused its collapse. The\\nadjective black has been appended to similar occasions ever since, including October 29, 1929, the\\nTuesday of the market collapse that marked the start of the Great Depression, and Black Monday\\nof October 19, 1987, when the stock market experienced its greatest fall since the Great \\nDepression. 2. Any day marked by great confusion or activity, as in It was just my luck to be \\ntraveling on Black Tuesday.  This usage, too, is based on the events of 1869, marked by economic \\nchaos. It has since been extended to other kinds of confusion, such as an accident hampering \\ntraffic during the evening rush hour. \\nblack hole \\n1. A wretched prison cell or other place of confinement. For example, The punishment is solitary \\nconfinement, known as the black hole.

Both versions of this expression, polite equivalents of BREAK ONE\\'S \\nASS, transfer the literal fracture of one\\'s back or neck to figurative exertion. \\nHowever, break one\\'s neck  has the secondary connotation of proceeding with \\nreckless speed, a sense also conveyed by the term breakneck pace.

The \\nfirst two hyperboles for the very narrowest margin date from the 1300s and 1400s respectively; \\nwhisker meaning \"a small amount\" was first recorded in 1913. Also see BY THE SKIN OF \\nONE\\'S TEETH; HANG BY A HAIR. \\nby all accounts Also, according to all accounts.  From all reports available, from what everyone\\nis saying. For example, By all accounts the party was a great success,  or They spent a fortune on \\ntheir cruise, according to all accounts.  These phrases rely on account in the sense of \"a particular \\nreport or description of some event.\" [Late 1700s] \\nby all means \\n1. Also, by all manner of means.  In every possible way, as in I plan to make use of him by all \\nmeans. [Late 1400s] 2. Also, by all manner of means.  Without fail, at any cost, as in Losing the \\ncontract is to be avoided by all means.  [c. 1600] 3. Certainly, yes, as in Are you coming tonight? ?\\nBy all means, I\\'ll be there.  [Late 1600s] Also see BY ANY MEANS; BY NO MEANS. \\nby all odds \\nBy far, as in She is by all odds the best player on the team.  This idiom uses odds in the sense of \\n\"the amount by which one thing excels or exceeds.\" [Mid-1800s] \\nby a long shot \\nhand. see under LONG SHOT. file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n147 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMby a mile \\nhand. see MISS BY A MILE. \\nby and by \\nAfter a while, soon, as in She\\'ll be along by and by.  The expression probably relies on the meaning \\nof by as a succession of quantities (as in \"two by two\"). This adverbial phrase came to be used as a\\nnoun, denoting either procrastination or the future. William Camden so used it for the former \\n(Remains, 1605): \"Two anons and a by and by is an hour and a half.\" And W.S. Gilbert used it in \\nthe latter sense when Lady Jane sings plaintively that little will be left of her \\'\\'in the coming by and \\nby,\" that is, as she grows old. ( Patience, 1881). [Early 1500s] \\nby and large \\nFor the most part, generally speaking, as in By and large the novel was a success.  This expression \\noriginated in 17th-century seamanship, where it referred to sailing into the wind and then off it, \\nwhich made it easier to steer. By the early 1700s the term had been broadened to mean \"in one \\ndirection and another,\" whence its present meaning of \"in general.\" For a synonym, see FOR THE\\nMOST PART. \\nby any means \\nIn any possible way, no matter how, as in By any means I\\'ve got to get there.  [Late 1400s] Also \\nsee BY HOOK OR CROOK; BY MEANS OF; BY NO MEANS. \\nby any stretch \\nBeyond ordinary limits, especially of the imagination. For example, She could not, by any stretch of\\nthe imagination, be considered a great actress.  The phrase sometimes is put in the negative, by \\nno stretch, as in By no stretch can that work be called an opera.  [Late 1700s] \\nby a thread \\nhand. see HANG BY A THREAD. \\nby chance \\nCasually, accidentally, as in I ran into Bill purely by chance.  [c. 1300] Also see BY \\nCOINCIDENCE. \\nby choice \\nDeliberately, as a matter of preference. For example, No one told me to come; I\\'m here by choice.\\nThis expression replaced the earlier with choice,  used from about 1500. \\nby coincidence \\nThrough an accidental simultaneous occurrence, as in By coincidence both researchers discovered \\nthe same solution.

For example, This antibiotic is by definition the most \\neffective now on the market.  [1970s] \\nby degrees \\nGradually, by successive steps or stages. For example, By degrees he began to delegate more and \\nmore of his duties to his staff.  [Mid-1500s] Also see BY INCHES. \\nby design \\nOn purpose, deliberately, as in Whether by luck or by design, his application was accepted.  This \\nterm, originally put as on design,  uses design in the sense of \"plan.\" [First half of 1600s] \\nby dint of \\nBy means of, as in By dint of hard work he got his degree in three years.  The word dint, which \\nsurvives only in this expression, originally meant \"a stroke or blow,\" and by the late 1500s signified\\nthe force behind such a blow. The current term preserves the implication of vigorous or persistent \\nmeans. \\nby far Also, far and away.  To the greatest degree, by a large margin. For example, She is by far \\nthe most experienced member of the cast,  or, as Anthony Trollope wrote, \"He was far and away \\nthe cleverest of his party\" ( The Duke\\'s Children,  1880). The first term dates from the late 1700s, \\nthe variant from the mid-1800s. Also see BY HALF. \\nby fits and starts \\nhand. see FITS AND STARTS. \\nbygones \\nhand. see LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. \\nby half \\nConsiderably, a great deal, as in He was too good a cook by half for this small restaurant.

For example, Betty had trouble \\nlearning the song by heart, but her teacher insisted on it,  or Japanese schools put heavy emphasis \\non learning by rote.  These terms are often put as know by heart  or learn by rote.  The first term \\nwas already used by Chaucer (in Troilus and Cressida ). The variant, also dating from the 1300s, \\noften implies mere memorization without deeper understanding. Both phrases remain in use, \\nalthough this form of learning is no longer so widespread as it once was. Also see COMMIT TO \\nMEMORY. \\nby hook or crook \\nBy any means possible, in one way or another. For example, The car broke down, but I\\'ll get there \\nby hook or crook.  This term has a disputed origin. A widely held theory is that it comes from the \\ncustom of allowing commoners to take as much wood from royal forests as they could reach with a\\nshepherd\\'s crook and cut down with a billhook. [1300s] Also see the synonym BY ANY MEANS. \\nby inches Also, inch by inch.  Gradually, bit by bit, as in We found ourselves in rush hour traffic, \\nmoving by inches.  Shakespeare used this term in Coriolanus  (5:4): \"They\\'ll give him death by \\ninches.\" Despite the increasing use of metric measurements, it survives, often as an exaggeration \\nof the actual circumstance. The phrase to inch along,  first recorded in 1812, means \"to move bit \\nby bit,\" as in There was a long line at the theater, just inching along. \\nby Jove Also, by cracky.  Used to express surprise or emphasis. For example, By Jove, I was glad \\nto see her,  or It was a great day, by cracky.  These mild oaths are euphemisms, the first for \"by \\nJesus\" or \"by God\" (Jove is another name for Jupiter, the principal Roman god), and the folksy \\nvariant by cracky  for \"by Christ.\" Both idioms may be dying out. \\nby leaps and bounds \\nRapidly, or in fast progress, as in The corn is growing by leaps and bounds,  or School enrollment is \\nincreasing by leaps and bounds.  This term is a redundancy, since leap and bound both mean \\n\"spring\" or \"jump,\" but the two words have been paired since Shakespeare\\'s time and are still so \\nused. \\nby means of \\nThrough the use of, owing to, as in We plan to pay for medical school by means of a second \\nmortgage, or He\\'ll succeed by means of sheer persistence.  [Early 1400s] Also see BY DINT OF. \\nby mistake \\nErroneously, as in He took my coat by mistake.  [c. 1700] \\nby no means Also, not by any means.  In no way, certainly not.

This \\nexpression is considered quite formal today. [c. 1300] \\nby request Also, on or upon request.  In response to being asked to do something. For example,\\nThe band is playing our favorite song by request.  This usage replaced at request.  [Late 1600s] \\nby rights \\nJustly, in fairness, as in By rights he should have been chosen first.  Originally put as by right, this \\nterm was first recorded about 1315. \\nby storm \\nhand. see TAKE BY STORM. \\nby surprise \\nhand. see TAKE BY SURPRISE. \\nby the balls \\nhand. see HAVE ONE BY THE BALLS. \\nby the board Fallen out of use, discarded. This expression usually is put as go by the board,  as \\nin With all the crime around here, the practice of leaving the house unlocked has gone by the \\nboard. The board here is the board of a ship, and the expression has been used since about 1630 \\nto signify something that has fallen overboard and been carried away. [Mid-1800s] \\nby the book \\nStrictly according to the rules, as in Our trip leader is going by the book, allowing us to wander off \\nonly for short periods. \\nShakespeare already used the term figuratively in Romeo and Juliet  (1:5): \"You kiss by the book.\" \\nAlso see BY THE NUMBERS. \\nby the bye Also, by the by.  Incidentally, in passing, as in By the bye, my wife is coming too,  or \\nExactly where do you live, by the by?  The bye or second by in this term originally meant \"a side file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n151 of 157 1/29/2008 10:07 AMpath,\" whence the current sense of \"off the track\" or \"of secondary importance.\" [Early 1500s] Also\\nsee BY THE WAY. \\nby the day Also, by the hour  or week or month or year. According to a specific time period, as\\nin I\\'m renting this car by the day,  or He\\'s being paid by the hour.  This usage generally describes \\nsome kind of rate. [1400s] \\nby the dozen Also, by the hundred  or thousand.  According to a definite quantity, as in She\\'s \\nbuying tapes by the dozen.  This usage is generally employed for some kind of rate. A 1950 film \\nabout efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth and his family was entitled Cheaper by the Dozen.  [c. 1300] \\nby the numbers \\nIn a strict sequence, step-by-step; also, mechanically. For example, The only way to assemble this \\ncomputer is to do it by the numbers,  or Writing a novel is not something one can do by the \\nnumbers. This expression has nothing to do with actual numerical figures (like BY THE DOZEN) \\nbut uses numbers in the sense of a strict order or sequence. \\nby the same token \\n1. In the same way, for the same reason. For example, He has a good ear for music, and by the \\nsame token he finds it easy to pronounce foreign words.  This phrase today is used in a general \\nway to connect statements that have some logical association with one another. [Mid-1400s] 2. As \\na corroborating circumstance, as in Boston\\'s population has grown very fast, and by the same \\ntoken its urban problems have also increased.  [Late 1800s] \\nby the seat of the pants \\nhand. see SEAT OF THE PANTS. \\nby the short hairs \\nUnder one\\'s complete control. This expression is often used with get or have, as in She had her \\nhusband by the short hairs.  It is in effect a euphemism for HAVE SOMEONE BY THE BALLS, \\nthe hairs in question being pubic hair. [Colloquial; second half of 1800s] \\nby the skin of one\\'s teeth \\nJust barely, very narrowly, as in Doug passed the exam by the skin of his teeth.  A related term \\nappears in the Bible (Job 19:20), where Job says, \"I am escaped with the skin of my teeth,\" \\npresumably meaning he got away with nothing at all. Today the phrase using by is used most often\\nto describe a narrow escape. [c. 1600] Also see SQUEAK THROUGH. \\nby the sweat of one\\'s brow \\nBy hard work, as in The only way he\\'ll succeed is by the sweat of his brow.  This figurative usage\\nappears in the Bible (Genesis 31:9), where Adam\\'s punishment for eating fruit in Eden is \"In the\\nsweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\"?\\nthat is, he will have to work for his bread, or living.

This term uses calculated  in the sense of \"planned with \\nforethought,\" a usage from the mid-1800s. Its pairing with risk dates from World War II, when the \\nchances for losing bombers were taken into account before a bombing mission was sent out. After \\nthe war the term was transferred to other undertakings where taking a chance to succeed had to \\nbe weighed against the costs of failure. \\ncalf \\nhand. see KILL THE FATTED CALF; PUPPY (CALF) LOVE. \\ncall \\nhand.

Deal \\nwith a situation when, and not before, it occurs. For example, If we can\\'t sell the house ?\\nwell, we\\'ll cross that bridge when we come to it.

For example, I told Mom I didn\\'t eat any cookies but I had my fingers crossed.  The \\nchildish belief that if one keeps one\\'s fingers crossed one may lie with impunity probably comes \\nfrom children\\'s games in which one was \"safe\" if one crossed one\\'s fingers, and the ultimate \\nallusion may be the same as in def. 1. \\ncross one\\'s mind Also, pass through one\\'s mind.  Suddenly occur to one, as in It never crossed \\nmy mind that they would turn the proposal down,  or It passed through her mind that he might \\nhave gotten lost.  [Mid-1700s] \\ncross over \\n1.

This phrase uses the quick in the \\nsense of a vital or a very sensitive part of the body, such as under the fingernails. It also appeared \\nin such older locutions as touched to the quick,  for \"deeply affected,\" and stung to the quick,\\nfor \"wounded, distressed,\" both dating from the early 1500s. The current expression was\\nconsidered a cliché from about 1850 on.\\ncut up \\n1. \\nDivide into smaller parts, break the continuity of, as in These meetings have cut up my whole day.\\n[c. 1800] 2.

Its figurative use dates \\nfrom about 1800. \\ndaily dozen \\nPhysical exercise, as in Helen walks two miles every morning ?\\nthat\\'s her daily dozen.  This term originally referred to a set of twelve specific calisthenic exercises \\nto be performed every day. They were devised by a famous Yale University football coach, Walter \\nCamp (1859-1925), and came into general use in the early 1900s. Despite the physical fitness \\ncraze of the late 1900s, these exercises and their name are no longer taken literally, but the term \\nsurvives in a very general way. \\ndaisy \\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with DAISY, also see FRESH AS A DAISY; \\nPUSH UP DAISIES. \\ndaisy chain \\n1. A series of connected events, activities, or experiences.

This pejorative expression \\ntransfers the reduced value of materials (stock, provisions, etc.) marred in some way to women \\nwho have had a sexual experience. [Early 1900s] \\ndamn \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with DAMN, also see DO ONE\\'S DAMNEDEST; \\nGIVE A DAMN; NOT WORTH A DIME (TINKER\\'S DAMN). \\ndamned if I do, damned if I don\\'t \\nA situation in which one can\\'t win. For example, If I invite Aunt Jane, Mother will be angry, and if I \\ndon\\'t, I lose Jane\\'s friendship ?\\nI\\'m damned if I do and damned if I don\\'t.  Eric Partridge suggested this idiom may have come from \\nthe emphatic I\\'m damned if I do,  meaning \\'\\'I definitely will not do something,\" but despite the \\nsimilar wording the quite different meaning argues against this theory. [Colloquial; first half of \\n1900s] Also see CATCH-22. \\ndamn well Also, damned well.  Certainly, without doubt; emphatically. For example, You damn \\nwell better improve your grades,  or I know damned well that he\\'s leaving me out.  The damn in this \\nphrase is mainly an intensifier. \\ndamn with faint praise \\nCompliment so feebly that it amounts to no compliment at all, or even implies condemnation. For \\nexample, The reviewer damned the singer with faint praise, admiring her dress but not mentioning \\nher voice.  This idea was already expressed in Roman times by Favorinus (c. A.D. 110) but the \\nactual expression comes from Alexander Pope\\'s Epistle to Doctor Arbuthnot\\n(1733): \"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, and, without sneering, \\nteach the rest to sneer.\" \\ndamper \\nhand. see PUT A DAMPER ON. \\ndance \\nhand.

As an imperative, the expression is associated with Victorian melodrama, \\nwhere someone (usually a young woman or man) is thrown out of the parental home for some \\nmisdeed, but it is actually much older. Benjamin Franklin used it in The Busybody  (1729): \"I am \\nafraid she would resent it so as never to darken my doors again.\" \\ndark horse \\nA little known, unexpectedly successful entrant, as in You never can tell ?\\nsome dark horse may come along and win a Senate seat.  This metaphoric expression originally \\nalluded to an unknown horse winning a race and was so used in a novel by Benjamin Disraeli ( The \\nYoung Duke,  1831). It soon began to be transferred to political candidates, among the first of \\nwhom was James K. Polk. He won the 1844 Democratic Presidential nomination on the eighth \\nballot and went on to win the election. \\ndash off file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n88 of 485 1/29/2008 10:37 AM1.

This term, first recorded in 1726, alludes to Davy Jones,  a name \\ngiven to the evil spirit of the sea. The ultimate origin of both Davy and Jones is disputed. A logical \\ntheory is that Jones referred to the biblical Jonah who was swallowed by a whale, and Davy was a \\ncorruption of a West Indian word for \"devil.\" \\ndawn \\nhand. In addition to the idiom beginning with DAWN, also see CRACK OF DAWN; \\nLIGHT DAWNED. \\ndawn on Also, dawn upon.  Become evident or understood, as in It finally dawned on him that he\\nwas expected to call them,  or Around noon it dawned upon me that I had never eaten breakfast.\\nThis expression transfers the beginning of daylight to the beginning of a thought process.

Long forgotten, no longer in use, as in That argument is \\ndead and buried,  or No point in worrying about regulations that are long dead and gone.  This \\nfigurative use of \"having died\" is usually applied to some issue. [Late 1800s] \\ndead as a doornail Also, dead as a dodo  or herring.

The first, oldest, and most common of these similes, \\nall of which can be applied literally to persons or, more often today, to issues, involves doornail,\\ndating from about 1350. Its meaning is disputed but most likely it referred to the costly metal nails \\nhammered into the outer doors of the wealthy (most people used the much cheaper wooden \\npegs), which were clinched on the inside of the door and therefore were \"dead,\" that is, could not \\nbe used again. Dead as a herring  dates from the 16th century and no doubt alludes to the bad \\nsmell this dead fish gives off, making its death quite obvious. Dead as a dodo,  referring to the \\nextinct bird, dates from the early 1900s. \\ndead beat \\n1. Defeated; also exhausted. For example, That horse was dead beat before the race even began,\\nor, as Charles Dickens put it in Martin Chuzzlewit  (1843): \"Pull off my boots for me . . . I am quite \\nknocked up.

For \\nexample, She moved without leaving a forwarding address, so her mail ended up in the dead letter\\noffice. [c. 1700] 2.

Extremely weary, as in Mom was in the kitchen all day and \\nwas dead on her feet,  or I\\'d love to go, but I\\'m dead tired.  The use of dead for \"tired to \\nexhaustion\" dates from the early 1800s, and dead on one\\'s feet,  conjuring up the image of a dead \\nperson still standing up, dates from the late 1800s. \\ndead ringer \\nA person or thing that closely resembles another; an exact counterpart.

Each one the other, one the other, as in The boys like each other,\\nor The birds were fighting one another over the crumbs.  Both of these phrases indicate a reciprocal\\nrelationship or action between the subjects preceding ( the boys, the birds ).

Capable of being accomplished with no \\ndifficulty, as in This crossword puzzle is easy as pie.  The first term presumably alludes to \\nconsuming pie (since making pie requires both effort and expertise).

Mark Twain had it in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court  (1889): \"I \\ncould do it as easy as rolling off a log.\" The first colloquial term dates from the early 1900s, the \\ncolloquial variants from the 1830s. For a synonym, see PIECE OF CAKE. \\neasy come, easy go \\nReadily won and readily lost, as in Easy come, easy go ?\\nthat\\'s how it is for Mark when he plays the stock market.

The first term\\'s origin has been lost, \\nalthough a story relates that it involved a War of 1812 encounter in which a British officer made an\\nAmerican soldier eat part of a crow he had shot in British territory. Whether or not it is true, the \\nfact remains that crow meat tastes terrible. The two variants originated in Britain. Dirt obviously \\ntastes bad. And humble pie  alludes to a pie made from umbles, a deer\\'s undesirable innards (heart,\\nliver, entrails).

[Colloquial; second half of 1900s] Also see \\nEAT OUT, def. 1. \\neat like a bird \\nEat very little, as in Jan is very thin ?\\nshe eats like a bird.  This simile alludes to the mistaken impression that birds don\\'t eat much (they \\nactually do, relative to their size), and dates from the first half of the 1900s. An antonym is eat \\nlike a horse,  dating from the early 1700s, and alluding to the tendency of horses to eat whatever \\nfood is available.

This hyperbolic expression \\nalmost always follows an if-clause, as in If he\\'s on time, I\\'ll eat my hat,  that is, \"I\\'ll consume my \\nheadgear if I\\'m wrong.\" Charles Dickens used it in Pickwick Papers  (1837): \"If I knew as little of life \\nas that, I\\'d eat my hat and swallow the buckle whole.\" [First half of 1800s] \\neat one\\'s heart out \\nFeel bitter anguish, grief, worry, jealousy, or another strong negative emotion.

For example, You\\'ve been putting off \\ncalling him for hours; either fish or cut bait.  This expression, often uttered as an imperative, \\nalludes to a fisherman who should either be actively trying to catch fish or cutting up bait for others \\nto use.

The first expression, with its analogy to the first and last courses of a\\nmeal, appeared in slightly different forms (such as from potage to cheese ) from the 1500s on; the \\nprecise wording here dates only from the mid-1900s.

In the mid1900s Friday was applied to a male servant and then a woman secretary or \\nclerk who works for a man. The expression girl Friday  gained currency through a motion picture \\nstarring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, His Girl Friday  (1940). Today it tends to be considered \\ncondescending and, applied to a woman, sexist. \\ngive \\nhand.

For example, Since you can\\'t come here for the \\nholiday, I\\'ll go to your house ?\\nif the mountain won\\'t come to Muhammad, Muhammad must go to the mountain. This expression \\nis based on a tale that Muhammad once sought proof of his teachings by ordering a mountain to \\ncome to him.

If something applies to you, accept it, as in These problems are hard to solve, \\nand most people would need help, so if the shoe fits, wear it!  This expression originated as if the \\ncap fits, which alluded to a fool\\'s cap and dates from the early 1700s. Although this version has not\\ndied out entirely, shoe today is more common and probably gained currency through the Cinderella\\nfairy tale, in which the prince sought her out by means of the slipper she lost at the ball. \\nif wishes were horses \\nIf one could readily have what one wanted, life would be easy.

This expression dates from about 1940 and originally alluded to \\npolitical opponents.

For example, It\\'ll take a lot of weekend \\novertime to finish, so if you can\\'t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.  This folksy adage has been\\nascribed to President Harry S. Truman, who certainly said it and may have originated it.

For example, She decided not to read the critics\\' reviews ?\\nignorance is bliss.  Although its truth may be dubious at best, this idea has been expressed since \\nancient times. The actual wording, however, comes from Thomas Gray\\'s poem, \"Ode on a Distant \\nProspect of Eton College\" (1742): \"Where ignorance is bliss, \\'tis folly to be wise.\" \\nill \\nhand. In addition to the idioms beginning with ILL, also see under GET SICK. \\nill at ease \\nUncomfortable, uneasy, as in Large parties made him feel ill at ease.

The first variant, blue streak,  also dates from the early 1800s and alludes to \\nsomething resembling lightning.

This simile replaced \\nthe 19th-century naked as a robin  and is equally unclear, since neither bird is normally stripped of \\nits feathers.

A popular theory for this expression\\'s file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n52 of 543 1/29/2008 11:48 AMorigin derives it from Dr. Samuel Mudd, the physician who was convicted as conspirator after he \\nset the broken ankle of President Lincoln\\'s assassin, John Wilkes Booth.

However, in the second half of \\nthe 1800s Australians already were using it for vast unsettled areas of their continent ( the \\noutback), and there the term became popular through Mrs. Aeneas Gunn\\'s We of the Never Never\\n(1908).

Similarly, put one\\'s nose out of joint  indicates the \\ncause of the upset, as in The boss\\'s praise of her assistant put Jean\\'s nose out of joint.

This \\nidiom originated in the late 1800s, possibly among troops stationed far from home, and became \\nwidespread during World War I. \\nnothing ventured, nothing gained \\nOne must take risks to achieve something, as in They quit their jobs, packed up, and moved to \\nWisconsin, saying \"nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"  Although this adage has appeared in slightly\\ndifferent form since the late 1300s, it was first recorded in this form only in 1624. For another \\nversion, see NO PAIN, NO GAIN. \\nnot hurt a fly Also, not hurt a flea.  Not cause harm to anyone, be gentle and mild, as in Paul\\'s \\nthe kindest man ?\\nhe wouldn\\'t hurt a flea,  or Bert has a temper but it\\'s all talk; he wouldn\\'t hurt a fly.  Both fly and \\nflea are used in the sense of \"a small insignificant animal.\" [Early 1800s] \\nnotice \\nhand. see ESCAPE NOTICE; GIVE NOTICE; SHORT NOTICE; SIT UP AND TAKE \\nNOTICE; TAKE NOTE (NOTICE). \\nnot if one can help it \\nOnly without one\\'s agreement, only if one cannot prevent it. For example, Is he taking a second \\njob??\\nNot if his wife can help it,  or He\\'s not riding on the back of that motorcycle, not if I can help it.  This\\nidiom uses help in the sense of \"prevent\" or \"cause to be otherwise.\" [Mid-1800s] \\nnot if you paid me \\nUnder no circumstances, as in I wouldn\\'t jump off the high diving board, not if you paid me.  [Late \\n1800s] \\nno time at all \\nhand. see IN NO TIME. \\nno time for, have \\nCan\\'t be bothered with, dislike, as in Dad has no time for her temper tantrums.

Be ignorant about \\nsomething, as in a poem published in the Yale Literary Magazine  in 1855: \"When our recent Tutor \\nis heard to speak, This truth one certainly gleans, Whatever he knows of Euclid and Greek, In Latin\\nhe don\\'t know beans.\" The beans in this colloquial phrase, dating from the early 1800s, signify \\nsomething small and worthless; not knowing the first thing  about something clearly shows one \\ndoesn\\'t know anything about it at all; and the third slangy phrase, with its double negative, implies \\nstupidity as well as ignorance, as in Poor girl, just starting out and she doesn\\'t know from nothing. \\nnot know enough to come in out of the rain \\nhand. see COME IN OUT OF THE RAIN. \\nnot know someone from Adam \\nBe unable to recognize someone, as in Although I have worked here for two months, I\\'ve never \\nseen the department head; I wouldn\\'t know her from Adam.  This term refers to the biblical story \\nabout the world\\'s first human being.

[Mid-1800s] \\nnot know where to turn Also, not know which way to jump or turn. Have no idea of \\nhow to get help or what course to take . For example, With all these offers coming in, he \\ndidn\\'t know where to turn,  or When her car was towed, Meg was distraught and did not know \\nwhich way to jump.

[Mid-1900s] \\nnot miss a trick Also, never miss a trick; not miss much.  Not fail to be aware of what is going\\non. For example, When it comes to the commodities market, Mark never misses a trick,  or Dad \\nmay seem absentminded, but he doesn\\'t miss much.  The first phrase dates from the early 1900s; file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n76 of 543 1/29/2008 11:48 AMthe variant employs miss in the sense of \"fail to perceive,\" a usage dating from the late 1600s. \\nnot move a muscle \\nhand. see MOVE A MUSCLE \\nnot my cup of tea \\nhand. see CUP OF TEA. \\nnot one iota \\nNot even the smallest amount, as in He got not one iota of thanks for his efforts.

The first recorded use of this interjection was\\nin 1896. \\nnot open one\\'s mouth Also, shut one\\'s mouth; not say  or utter a word.

For example, I wouldn\\'t \\nput it past him to tell a lie or two.  This expression uses past in the sense of \"beyond.\" [Late 1800s]\\nnot right in the head \\nMentally unsound, as in Physically, she\\'s quite healthy for ninety, but we suspect she\\'s not right in \\nthe head.  This usage was first recorded as right in his wits  in 1662. \\nnot see beyond one\\'s nose file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n77 of 543 1/29/2008 11:48 AM\\nhand. see CAN\\'T SEE BEYOND THE END OF ONE\\'S NOSE. \\nnot suffer fools gladly \\nRefuse to tolerate stupidity, as in Chris can be intimidating at these meetings; she does not suffer \\nfools gladly.  This expression comes from the New Testament (II Corinthians 11:19), where Paul \\nsarcastically says, \"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.\" [c. 1600] \\nnot take no for answer \\nhand. see TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. \\nnot the half of it \\nhand. see HALF OF IT. \\nnot the only fish in the sea Also, lots or plenty of good fish in the sea; not the only \\npebble on the beach.  Plenty of other suitable persons, especially for a romantic relationship. For \\nexample, When Bob walked out on Sally, all we could tell her was that he was not the only fish in \\nthe sea, or Bill knew she wasn\\'t the only pebble on the beach but he was determined to win her \\nover. Both fish and pebble here refer to something available in large quantities. The expressions \\nusing fish have been used to comfort jilted lovers since the early 1500s. The variant using pebble\\nwas first recorded in a poem of 1896 by Henry Braistead: \"If you want to win her hand Let the \\nmaiden understand That she\\'s not the only pebble on the beach.\" \\nnot think much of \\nHave little regard for, have a low opinion of, as in Bill doesn\\'t think much of the carpentry work in \\nthat house.  The phrase not much  has been used in this sense since the mid-1800s. \\nnot to be sneezed at Also, nothing to sneeze at.  Not to be ignored or dismissed, as in It\\'s a \\ngreat honor, not to be sneezed at,  or That salary of his is nothing to sneeze at.  This expression \\npresumably alludes to turning up one\\'s nose in disdain. [c. 1800] \\nnot to mention Also, not to speak of; to say nothing of.  In addition to, besides what\\'s already\\nbeen said. For example, I don\\'t think the voters will want that big program, not to mention the \\ncost, or Dave teaches trumpet and trombone, not to speak of other brass instruments,  or Their \\nhouse is worth at least a million, to say nothing of their other assets. \\nnot touch with a ten-foot pole \\nStay far away from, avoid completely, as in Ronald wouldn\\'t touch raw oysters with a ten-foot pole.\\nThis expression dates from the mid-1700s, when it began to replace the earlier not to be handled \\nwith a pair of tongs.  In the 1800s barge-pole  was sometimes substituted for ten-foot pole,  but that \\nvariant has died out. \\nnot to worry \\nhand. see NO PROBLEM. \\nnot turn a hair file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n78 of 543 1/29/2008 11:48 AM\\nhand. see TURN A HAIR. \\nnot up to \\nhand. see UP TO. \\nnot worth a damn Also, not worth a plugged nickel  or red cent  or bean or hill of beans  or \\nfig or straw or tinker\\'s damn.  Worthless, as in That car isn\\'t worth a damn,  or My new tennis \\nracket is not worth a plugged nickel.  As for the nouns here, a damn or curse is clearly of no great \\nvalue (also see NOT GIVE A DAMN); a plugged nickel  in the 1800s referred to a \\ndebased five-cent coin; a cent denotes the smallest American coin, which was red\\nwhen made of pure copper (1800s); a bean has been considered trivial or \\nworthless since the late 1300s (Chaucer so used it), whereas hill of beans  alludes \\nto a planting method whereby four or five beans are put in a mound (and still are \\nworthless); and both fig and straw have been items of no worth since about 1400.\\nA tinker\\'s dam,  first recorded in 1877, was a wall of dough raised around a spot \\nwhere a metal pipe is being repaired so as to hold solder in place until it hardens, \\nwhereupon the dam is discarded. However, tinker\\'s damn  was first recorded in \\n1839 and probably was merely an intensification of \\'\\'not worth a damn,\" rather \\nthan having anything to do with the dam. \\nno two ways about it \\nNo room for difference of opinion, no alternative, as in We have to agree on the nomination, and \\nno two ways about it.  [Early 1800s] \\nno use, it\\'s \\n1. It\\'s impossible; it can\\'t succeed. For example, It\\'s no use; these pieces just don\\'t fit.  [c. 1800] 2.\\nAlso, it\\'s no use to man or beast.

This phrase was first recorded in 1560. \\nnow that \\nSeeing that, since, as in Now that you\\'re here, you might as well stay for dinner.  This usage was \\nfirst recorded in 1530.

For example, He nursed one drink for \\nthe whole evening.  This idiom alludes to holding a glass very carefully, as one might a child. [c. \\n1940] \\nnurse a grudge \\nBear resentment for a long time, as in We don\\'t know why Karl looks so angry; I think he\\'s nursing \\na grudge against the family.

Because . . . they both raised \\nCain.\" This statement makes a pun on raise, meaning \"bring up\" or \"nurturing.\" The two variants, \\nalluding to bringing hell or the devil up to this world, are older, the first from about 1700, the \\nsecond from about 1800. \\nraise eyebrows \\nhand. see CAUSE RAISED EYEBROWS. \\nraise havoc \\nhand. see PLAY HAVOC. \\nraise hell \\nhand. see under RAISE CAIN. \\nraise one\\'s hackles \\nMake one very angry, as in That really raised my hackles when he pitched straight at the batter\\'s \\nhead.

In today\\'s security-conscious climate, where alarm systems to deter \\nhousebreaks have become increasingly common, this simile may seem puzzling.

The\\nfirst of these terms, calling a man the son of a female dog, dates from the early \\n1300s and is considered vulgar enough to have given rise to the two variants, \\nboth euphemisms. The first variant, an abbreviation, dates from World War I. The \\nsecond, first recorded in 1708, gave rise to the theory that it originally applied to \\nbaby boys born at sea (in the days when women accompanied their husbands on \\nlong voyages). The explanation seems unlikely, especially since presumably some \\nof the babies were girls. It also once meant the illegitimate son of a soldier (or \\n\"gun\"). More probably, however, son of a gun  evolved simply as a euphemism for \\nthe first term and appealed because of its rhyme. Both it and son of a bitch  are \\nalso put as interjections expressing surprise, amazement, disgust, or \\ndisappointment, as in Son of a bitch!

[Colloquial; mid-1900s] \\nthat\\'s one on me \\nThat\\'s a joke at my expense, as in And after all that discussion they didn\\'t show up ?\\nthat\\'s one on me.  This phrase must be distinguished from that\\'s a new one on me,  which means\\n\"this is the first time I\\'ve heard of or seen that\" (as in A checkerboard \\nrug?\\nthat\\'s a new one on me ). Both idioms can be used with other personal pronouns (for example, \\nthat\\'s one on you ) and date from the early 1900s. \\nthat\\'s right \\nYes; that\\'s correct; I agree. For example, Are you leaving early? ?\\nThat\\'s right, I have to go now,  or So you were classmates? ?\\nThat\\'s right.  [c. 1900] \\nthat\\'s that Also, that takes care of that.

In the \\nsingular and modified forms, this term becomes good or bad or lucky break.  In the plural form, \\nonly the context determines its favorable or unfavorable meaning. [Slang; early 1900s] Also see \\nTOUGH BREAK. \\nthe business \\n1. Verbal abuse, scolding, or teasing; also, a beating. For example, At boarding school new kids \\nalways get the business,  or The boxer faked and then gave his opponent the business.  [Slang; c. \\n1940] 2. A harsh interrogation, as in The detectives gave each suspect the business.  [Slang; c. \\n1940] 3.

[Slang; c. 1940] \\nthe creeps Also, the willies.  A sensation of horror or repugnance, as in That weird man gives me\\nthe creeps,  or I get the willies when I hear that dirge music.  The first of these colloquial terms \\nalludes to a sensation of something crawling on one\\'s skin. Charles Dickens used it in David \\nCopperfield  (1849) to describe a physical ailment: \"She was constantly complaining of the cold and \\nof its occasioning a visitation in her back, which she called \\'the creeps.\\'\" But soon after it was used \\nto describe fear and loathing. The variant dates from the late 1800s, and both its allusion and \\norigin are unclear. \\nthe damage \\nThe cost or price of something, as in So what\\'s the damage for this outfit?

This idiom is nearly always used in a snobbish context that puts down the\\ntaste, intelligence, or some other quality of the majority of people. W.S. Gilbert satirized this view \\nin the peers\\' march in Iolanthe (1882), in which the lower-middle class and the masses are ordered\\nto bow down before the peers. Prime Minister William Gladstone took a different view (Speech, \\n1886): \"All the world over, I will back the masses against the [upper] classes.\" [First half of 1800s] \\nthe matter \\nhand. see WHAT\\'S THE MATTER. \\nthe more the merrier \\nhand. see MORE THE MERRIER. \\nthem\\'s fighting words \\nhand. see FIGHTING WORDS. \\nthen \\nhand.

A number of religious leaders, including John \\nBunyan, have been credited with it as well. \\nthereby hangs a tale \\nThat detail or incident reminds one of another story, as in So he went without supper, but thereby \\nhangs a tale.

This simile, which \\nuses rail in the sense of \"a narrow bar,\" has largely replaced such other versions as thin as a lath\\nor rake, although the latter is still common in Britain. [Second half of 1800s] \\nthin edge of the wedge \\nA minor change that begins a major development, especially an undesirable one. For example, First \\nthey asked me to postpone my vacation for a week, and then for a month; it\\'s the thin edge of the \\nwedge and pretty soon it\\'ll be a year.

This term alludes to the rail that supplies the high voltage powering an electric train, so called \\nsince 1918.

Hip, hip, hooray!  Why \\none should shout one\\'s encouragement or approbation three times rather than two or four is \\nunclear. A shouted cheer presumably originated as a nautical practice, if we are to believe Daniel \\nDefoe in Captain Singleton  (1720): \"We gave them a cheer, as the seamen call it.\" Three cheers\\nwas first recorded in 1751. The term is also used sarcastically, when one is not really offering \\ncongratulations, as in So you finally passed; well, three cheers for you. \\nthree-ring circus \\nA situation of complete confusion, as in It was a three-ring circus, with the baby crying, the dog \\nbarking, both telephones ringing, and someone at the front door.

In any event, the term was picked up \\nby others and so used from the early 1800s on. \\nthree\\'s a crowd Also, two\\'s company, three\\'s a crowd.  A third person spoils the ideal \\ncombination of a couple, as in \\nNo, I won\\'t join you ?\\nthree\\'s a crowd.

For a synonym, see FIFTH WHEEL. \\nthree sheets to the wind Also, three sheets in the wind.  Drunk, inebriated, as in After six \\nbeers he\\'s three sheets to the wind. This expression is generally thought to refer to the sheet??\\nthat is, a rope or chainthat holds one or both lower corners of a sail. If the sheet is allowed to go \\nslack in the wind, the sail flaps about and the boat is tossed about much as a drunk staggers. \\nHaving three sheets loose would presumably make the situation all the worse. Another explanation \\nholds that with two or four sheets to the wind the boat is balanced, whereas with three it is not. \\n[Mid-1800s] \\nthrill to pieces Also, thrill to death.  Give great pleasure, delight, as in I was just thrilled to \\npieces with our new grandson,  or He was thrilled to death when he first saw the Himalayas.

Everything, every aspect or element, as in The \\naccountant went through the whole megillah all over again,  or Her divorce lawyer took him for the \\nhouse, the car, the whole schmeer.

This expression comes from the name of a famous reference work, Who\\'s \\nWho, first published in 1849, which contains biographical sketches of famous individuals and is \\nregularly updated. Its name in turn was based on who is who,  that is, the identity of each of a file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Owner/My%20Documen...\\n517 of 543 1/29/2008 11:48 AMnumber of persons, a phrase dating from the late 1300s.

The paper introduces the Transformer, a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, instead of using recurrence. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Additionally, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.'"
